It's just a housewife's chat...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you. I haven't seen your face<__>around here, right?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm from the city of<__>Cyril in Phandaria.<00>

[ENDBLOCK]
Mother<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's already decided for the aunts'<__>well-end meeting!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now, I'm talking about<__>General <Dryden>.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a little scary, isn't he?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's true that some people<__>do think that.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
But he's a very popular person<__>in Darilsheid.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That man?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Even though he is a<__>civilian employee, he is the one<__>who thinks about safety and<__>happiness first.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a surprising fact. The next<__>time we meet, We'll make fun of<__>this story.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Making fun of me, <Mary>...<__>Are you <Rutee> now?<00>

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to get rid of our<__>debt right away.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee><00>

Otherwise, there may not<__>be a tomorrow<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you say so...<00>

[ENDBLOCK]
I have my doubts about this person...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The inhabitants of the city<__>are also quite upset.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
No wonder.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you were shown such an aerial<__>city and even attacked...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sordian Masters! What the<__>hell is this?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow... such a huge building is<__>floating in the sky!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
And that intense light! What a<__>tremendous amount of technology!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, why are you so flirting<__>when your country is destroyed?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indiscriminate crustal fracturing<__>weapon Bergland.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the true nature of the<__>light released from Dycroft.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The purpose is to destroy the ground,<__>as it is in the street.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said the aerial city was used<__>in the Tenchi war...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Aeth'er Wars...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I have no choice but to tell<__>you the truth.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
A thousand years ago, there was a<__>great war involving all humankind.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was the ground forces to which we<__>belonged and as such the Heavenly<__>Army of the aerial city.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the Aeth'er War...! It wasn't<__>just a legend, was it?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni's Eye played a big role<__>in the Aeth'er War.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was,uA sword caught in a<__>worldwide calamityv.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I 'm sorry I didn't<__>say anything.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
We wanted to erase the memory of<__>the Aeth'er war from the<__>history of mankind.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not to repeat, the mistakes<__>of the past.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
But as a result, the aerial<__>city has been revived...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
People of the earthly world!<__>Do you see our power?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>...What are you doing?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What you see above you is the<__>aerial city of the Aeth'er War.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That we have revived from a<__>thousand years long sleep!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
We do not forgive at all.<__>No exceptions are allowed.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It does not allow the people of<__>the earthly world who can only<__>crawl on the ground like insects.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will confine everything on the<__>earthly world to the darkness.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait with trembling expectations!<__>Mwahahaha!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Hugo>. Are you going to pretend<__>to be the king of the heavenly<__>world!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The way he talks is<__>like that man.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What should I do now?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you use the Draconis, you<__>can not reach that aerial city...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there no way for us to compete?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, not yet!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
As it is... Can I be left alone!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you hear me, <Hugo>I<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who will make you like it!<__>Who will do what you want!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will definitely be rewarded...!<__><Lion>'s enemies will definitely be taken!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you understand!<__>Remember, <Hugo>I<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
HHHH<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That spirit, young master.<__>well said!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That kind of...It can't be.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, this voice<__>is unmistakable.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
HHHH<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian team, it's not a<__>case of depressed!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
HHHH<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
We still have the potential!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Who?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mercurius <Ritora>.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was the one who once led<__>us as the commander of the<__>ground forces.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
In case of an emergency, I also<__>transcribed my personality to<__>the core crystal.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where does your voice come from...?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
The communication function that is<__>built into me is being used.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I'm in the heart of Radisrol.<__>The strategy meeting is carried<__>out immediately from this.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gather the Swordian team and<__>hurry to Radisrol!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is the first call order<__>in a thousand years.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you'll get by, right?<__>We can still do something<__>about it, right?<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, <Stahn> Aileron.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be afraid under any<__>circumstances! Use all means<__>to accomplish your mission!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the Swordian team!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, I understand!<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, let's head<__>right out away.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have already picked up the sea<__>dragon. Try going outside.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Radisrol was moved to the sea.<__>Waiting for arrival.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Excellency, I would like to<__>work with them to gather information.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, you have permission.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew. I thought I'd be able to<__>go home soon, but I didn't go<__>that way.<00>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia><00>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to see Atamoni's<__>Eye sealed.<00>
