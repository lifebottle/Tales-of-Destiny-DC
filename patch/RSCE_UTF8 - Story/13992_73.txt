Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? I believe you are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. You're the one that 
defeated <Lilith> in the arena?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
And there it is!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Don't talk to 
me like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it? Eh, uh~...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay to talk about <Lilith>,
you can talk about her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the one. I thought I'd
give you some good information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Didn't we once have a pirate
invasion of this city?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you mean <Batista>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
One of them is a sunken pirate ship.
in this area of the ocean.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's also possible that some
treasure had sunk with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you don't want to share
such valuable information with me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's at the bottom of the sea,
anyway. I'll never get there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Lilith>, say thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish I was stronger.
I can't do it, can I?
[ENDBLOCK]
Begin creating the ocean.

I'm worried about the produce crops,

[ENDBLOCK]
If you hang around here long
enough, you can get leftovers.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
Take it home and eat together.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I'm hungry...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The city's opinion of
Oberon is controversial.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a long-time resident, but I think 
it's good for the city to develop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I think that Ms. <Ilene> is fine with
evacuating the residents without
taking their own risks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Has <Ilene> gotten over this city?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Seingald has sent a large number
of soldiers to the damaged area.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
But the government of this country
doesn't do anything in this situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The government doesn't do anything,
even though we don't know when the
city will be attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Rather than waiting for the powers
that be, I was thinking of doing
what I could.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't much, But I
gave what lens I could.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know why that barbarian
<Kongman> or whatever, is so popular.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> took out a fleet of armed
ships? Hmmm, can't get it out of my head.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, are you going somewhere?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Where's <Kongman> going to go?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> is the hero of this city,
right? Then protect this city!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, I was wrong. I'm sorry
for being so selfish.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck in your quest to save
the world. Mighty! Mighty! Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Go for it! <Kongman>！
Mighty! Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nun
[ENDBLOCK]
People who are satisfied with material
things are not necessarily mentally
satisfied as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nun
[ENDBLOCK]
What this city needs most right now,
is a Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nun
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish we had a temple in this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nun
[ENDBLOCK]
It is at times like this that we
should spread the teachings of
Atamoni to the people of the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nun
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this another test
that Atamoni has given us...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nun
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni will surely be a guide
on your path ahead.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
This is good enough for your skill

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The "Definite Strike" is 
a group attack effective
against monsters.

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can perform a Definite Strike
by setting [Definite Strike] to 
"ON" from the Customize menu
in the Main menu.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can also view each monster's
Definite Strike in the Monster Book
if Definite Strike is [ON].
[ENDBLOCK]

Hmm?　I've got nothing
more to give you.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You'll have to hone 
your skills a bit more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
So this is Neuestadt... the city
at the heart of Fitzgald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My hometown, Lienea,
is also here in Fitzgald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not my only motivation...
but we've gotta find <Greybum> soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, we're going to <Ilene>'s estate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> is the head of Oberon Corp.
in the Fitzgald region.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'd be a good idea to make
use of her influence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're taking a ship. We're going
out to sea to strike down that armeida.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait! I'm going with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to protect our town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> is doing her best, too. I'm
not going to let her out-do me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's fight together!
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
When you're ready, just give a
shout. We'll sail out!
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a considerable amount of
enemy ships. As soon as we leave
port, we'll attack!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bring it on! I'll throw everything away!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our aim is the flagship. We don't
have enough time to do a thorough search.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, we have to put an end to this,
fast. Please bring us to the most
prominent ship!
[ENDBLOCK]
It's gonna be a bit rough,
so hold on tight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for the welcome, everyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Champion <Kongman> has defeated
the evil and returned victorious!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Mighty!	Mighty!	Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Mighty!	Mighty!	Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Kong wasn't the
only one there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's quickly return to <Ilene>'s
estate. Sorry about all this noise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just remembered something I need
to do. Go on ahead without me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmmm. <Stahn> looks pretty
worried about <Ilene>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if he likes
older women...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, are you... disappointed?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-not at all! I would never. 
It's impossible. Completely out
of the question!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you really shot that down 
with everything you've got.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmmm... What was that ship?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
When you all were fighting 
out at sea, a ship from the
armada docked here.
[ENDBLOCK]
But it left immediately after. 
So what the heck was that about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
A ship...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you get close to Aquaveil,
please use a rowboat to get to land.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for taking
care of us, <Ilene>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh... <Philia>, you're
really going, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I weren't helping to rebuild the
town, I would come along with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'll be okay. You're needed
here in town, <Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, how are you so kind!!
What an inspiration!! Uwahhhhh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a nice interpretation.
That's good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! Please protect
<Philia> properly in my place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If anything happens to <Philia>,
I will destroy you!!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry, it'll be fine.
Leave everything to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, we're leaving now.
Really, thank you so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, don't forget about our
challenge from earlier, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't forget. Who'll realize
their ideal first, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope we'll have some results
the next time we meet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ideals, huh…. wonder if that's
something easier said than done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, take care!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going to get
on this ship.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's <Kongman>! How have you been?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the champion, how
can I not be cheerful?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going to Phandaria,
aren't we? I'm coming with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a champion, and you're
willing to leave the city?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried about you 
guys, that's why!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you feel that way, but
please don't take it too hard. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't be shy. It's
just you and me, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How did we get along...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman><x00>Anyway, I'm coming with you!
I've already decided!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright. I'll take care
of it <Kongman>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take care of everything!
Ga-ha-ha-ha!

Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll

<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,

Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

ぞくぞく流入してくるのです。
[ENDBLOCK]
婦人
[ENDBLOCK]
このままだと、この街は、
人で溢れてしまいます。
[ENDBLOCK]
婦人
[ENDBLOCK]
おまけに、あいつらときたら
騒ぎばかりを起こすんです……
全く、嫌になりますよ！
[ENDBLOCK]
セインガルド人
[ENDBLOCK]
おい、おまえ！
文句があるのか！
[ENDBLOCK]
街の人
[ENDBLOCK]
これ以上、街に人はいらないんだ。
てめえの国に帰りやがれ！
[ENDBLOCK]
セインガルド人
[ENDBLOCK]
なんと野蛮な人種だ。
吐き気がする！
[ENDBLOCK]
街の人
[ENDBLOCK]
だったら、帰ればいいじゃない！
[ENDBLOCK]
街の人
[ENDBLOCK]
だったら、そういうおまえらも、
ここから出て行けよ！
[ENDBLOCK]
街の人
[ENDBLOCK]
なんですって！	あんたたち
みたいなのがいるから、この街は、
いつまでも発展しないんでしょ！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
おい、止めろよおめえら！
いったいどうしちまったんだ！
[ENDBLOCK]
街の人
[ENDBLOCK]
邪魔するんじゃねえ！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
みなさん、どうしたんですか！
こんな事じゃ<Ilene>さんが！
[ENDBLOCK]
婦人
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>は逃げ出したんだろ！
口ばっかの理想家じゃないか。
[ENDBLOCK]
街の人
[ENDBLOCK]
違うわよ。あの人は
ただの妄想家よ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
なんて事言うんだ！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
おい、やめろ<Stahn>。
おめえまで熱くなってどうする！
[ENDBLOCK]
街の人
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>のやった事が、
この街のどこに残っていると
言うんだ、ふざけるな！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
そんな……
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
そんな事ないよ！	お姉ちゃんが、
僕たちに教えてくれたじゃないか！
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
大人は金持ちも貧乏もみんな、
自分の事ばかりだ。
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
でも、僕たちは違うからね。
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
そうだ！	僕たちが絶対に、
この街を変えてみせるからね。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
そうだぜ、みんな！	子供にだけ
格好いい事を言わせておくのか！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
俺様たち大人が、だせえ事言って
らんねえだろ！
[ENDBLOCK]
街の人
[ENDBLOCK]
確かに……こんな子供に言われっぱなしも
情けないよな。
[ENDBLOCK]
婦人
[ENDBLOCK]
そうね……そうよ！	みんなでこの街を
もっと良くしていきましょうよ。

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>さん。俺との競争……
あなたの方が一歩リードしている
みたいです。
[ENDBLOCK]
婦人
[ENDBLOCK]
以前より、街での
もめごとが増えています。
[ENDBLOCK]
婦人
[ENDBLOCK]
街のヒーローさえ
いてくれれば……<x00>
