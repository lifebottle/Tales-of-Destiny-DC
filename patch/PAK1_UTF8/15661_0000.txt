Your master is quite unique, Atwight.
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not a bad kid at heart...
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that you have chosen
an interesting master as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's good that he has a straightforward
personality, but he's too good-natured.
[ENDBLOCK]
His skill with a sword is still in its
infancy. He needs to train hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, that sounds like fun.
[ENDBLOCK]
Atwight, by the way...
Has that time come...?
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know, either. First of all,
I don't know where it is.
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope the fact that you and I are awake
is not a bad sign.<x00>
