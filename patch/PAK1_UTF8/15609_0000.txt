[ENDBLOCK]
The Draconis was attacked by monsters?
That's an unusual thing to happen. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it? 
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though the lens have made them more violent,
those monsters were once ordinary wild animals. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Their instincts wouldn't let them confront
an entity as intimidating as
the Draconis. 
[ENDBLOCK]
It's like they're being controlled
by a beastmaster... 
[ENDBLOCK]
It's possible someone forced them to do it. 
[ENDBLOCK]
But I've never heard of anyone who
could achieve such a thing. <x00>
