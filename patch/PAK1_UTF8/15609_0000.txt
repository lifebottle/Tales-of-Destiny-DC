The Draconis was attacked by monsters?
That's a rare occurance indeed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens may have made them more violent, but
those monsters were once ordinary wild animals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Their instincts wouldn't let them confront
an entity as intimidating as the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe a beastmaster was controlling them...
[ENDBLOCK]
It's plausible that they were being manipulated
[ENDBLOCK]
I have never heard of anyone who
was capable of such things. <x00>
