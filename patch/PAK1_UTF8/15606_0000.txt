Are you training under Master <Alba>
to be an archer, <Woodrow>? 
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah yes. I started when I was a child.
It's been almost 20 years now. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Twenty years, huh? If you've been together
that long, you're practically family. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, definitely. I've learned much from him.
Both in archery, and life itself.<x00>
