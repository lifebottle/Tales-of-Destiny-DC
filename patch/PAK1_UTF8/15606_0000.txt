Are you training to be an archer
under Master <Alba>, <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. I started when I was a child.
It's been almost 20 years now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Twenty years, huh? If you've been together
that long, you're practically family.
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, definitely. I've learned much from him.
Not only about archery, but about life itself.<x00>
