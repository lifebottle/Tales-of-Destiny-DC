[ENDBLOCK]
So, <Stahn>, why were you
on board the Draconis?
[ENDBLOCK]
I really wanted to go to Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
But... I didn't have the money for a boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
So you're saying you just snuck aboard?
You shouldn't be so reckless.
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no choice! The fare was
way more money than I could afford.
[ENDBLOCK]
If you didn't have enough money,
why didn't you save up for it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I guess I couldda done that...
[ENDBLOCK]
He honestly didn't think about
that until I said something...<x00>
