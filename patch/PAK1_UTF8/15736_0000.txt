<Stahn>, you're tougher than I am,
so I want you to take the lead in battle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha. Just leave it to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, are you OK with this?
You sure <Lion>'s not just using you?
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's not like that at all. I'll hold
the enemy off, and <Lion> will finish them!
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Right. It's a very basic strategy,
but also a very important one.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's kind of weird seeing
those two talk so casually...<x00>
