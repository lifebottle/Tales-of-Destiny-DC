In order to protect King <Woodrow>, I would have

I thought you were only a child, <Chelsea>,

[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so happy I could...lay my hands upon...
my daughter...one final time...
[ENDBLOCK]
I can...pass...in peace...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You're the only mother I have...!
I-if I lose you, then...I'll..!
[ENDBLOCK]
Noooooo!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, woah, woah, woah, hold it! This is going
beyond an adlib! You're flat out changing the story!
