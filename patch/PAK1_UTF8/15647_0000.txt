...Oh, jeez!
[ENDBLOCK]
It's disgraceful of a lens hunter
to fall for such a simple trap.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, so you're a lens hunter?
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. I'll go anywhere for lens,
no matter the risks!
[ENDBLOCK]
...That's the creed we Lens Hunters live by.
[ENDBLOCK]
So if you got caught in a trap, you
shouldn't be complaining about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
That was...! That was just a slip up.
I'm usually more dexterous than that.<x00>
