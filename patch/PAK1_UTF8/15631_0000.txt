<Stahn>, do you cook for yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
My sister takes care of most of the
housekeeping, so not really...

...Oh wait! There was this one time grandpa and
sis slept in, and I made them some porridge!
[ENDBLOCK]
That was nice of you! They
must have been delighted!
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, they were pretty happy, but
they told me to never do it again.
[ENDBLOCK]
"Any more and we'd fear for our lives," they
said. They were probably exaggerating.
[ENDBLOCK]
...Something tells me they weren't.<x00>
