That was quite a challenge.
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. I'm glad to have answered all the questions
correctly. I feel like my daily practice paid off.
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, how will you decide the
president of the quiz club?
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder who would be more
appropriate, <Philia> or <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. The answers to all the questions were
won through the efforts of everyone, so...
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't we just divide it into a men's and
a women's club, and we'll each do our own thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, that's a good idea!
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, <Woodrow> will lead the men's club
and <Philia> will lead the women's club!<x00>
