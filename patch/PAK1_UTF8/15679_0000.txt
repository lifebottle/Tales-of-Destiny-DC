Hugo mentioned "The Seven generals".
What are they?
[ENDBLOCK]
They are the seven top commanders of the
Seinegaldian Army.
[ENDBLOCK]
General Dryden is one of them, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah...
[ENDBLOCK]
Given my master's strength, I personally believe
he should be added to them as the Eighth General.
[ENDBLOCK]
It would only be appropriate.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's enough, Chal.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah..S-Sorry, excuse me.<x00>
