The Temple sure has a lot of ranks,
huh? "High Priest", "Bishop"...
[ENDBLOCK]
The top of the hierarchy starts at Archbishop,
then below that is Bishop, then High Priest.
[ENDBLOCK]
What about you, <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm still a Priestess.
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, so you'll go from Priestess, to
High Priestess, then you'll be a Bishop!
[ENDBLOCK]
Absolutely not! I still have long to go before
even considering preaching to people myself!<x00>
