...Hahh...
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been sighing like that for a while now.
It's kind of annoying, Chal.
[ENDBLOCK]
But Young Master! You don't
understand what I've been through!!
[ENDBLOCK]
...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos> and <Atwight>...
[ENDBLOCK]
For the longest time, those two would stick together
and worry about one another...
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever <Atwight> was in trouble,
<Dymlos> would come running out of nowhere to help!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>, as if by instinct,
would always cover <Dymlos> from afar!
[ENDBLOCK]
Then you've got me, someone who's used
to being up front or in the rear...
[ENDBLOCK]
Caught right in the middle of those two lovebirds,
who had no idea how obvious they were being!!
[ENDBLOCK]
They'd stop in the middle of battle, just to gaze
at each other, and I, who had to pretend not
to notice, got stuck doing ALL THE FIGHTING!!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
...Gimme a break, already!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
..I..I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
...Indeed, you do.<x00>
