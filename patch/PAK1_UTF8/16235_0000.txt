Master <Lion>, have you been
acting kind to everyone lately?
[ENDBLOCK]
Not especially, no.
[ENDBLOCK]
But...<Marian> said so herself.
She said that you had changed, lately!
[ENDBLOCK]
Just because she said that doesn't necessarily
mean that I've been getting soft or anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, fine! I guess not!
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's so important to
be nice to everyone you meet...
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you scolding
me for, Chal?<x00>
