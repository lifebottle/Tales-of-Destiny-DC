<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
There might be someone over there. 
Let's go have a look.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There is a pedestal
where the sword was placed.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>The screen seems to be showing
the status of the ship.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gramps...
<Lilith>...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No...! I don't want to die
in a place like this!

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
You there!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you can hear my voice.
Perhaps you have the ability.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-who's there?

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to know?
Then come deeper inside.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Deeper?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Something shined...
way over there.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no one here...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is...a sword?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It has a pretty weird shape,
can I even use this...?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Arghh, this isn't the time
to worry about that!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as I have a weapon,
I won't lose to the likes of you!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with this sword? It's weird,
like my hand is already used to it...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Draconis...!
Will it be to be okay?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what's going
on outside.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
!...What am I doing...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Master, did you notice!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the Draconis warehouse.
Do you remember now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll let <Hugo> know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that, I was shoved in here...
I think It's been about five days now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Master, You were asleep 
for so long, so I thought...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal......
I'm sorry for worrying you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
But still, what a disaster.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true, not when 
you're dealing with that guy. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I really feel sorry for myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm invincible with Chal...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I changed my name to say I
was trying to grow up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I try to think it's for my
sister's sake that I don't
tell her who I am.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, I'm always so selfish.'
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't blame yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you, a visiting
swordsman of the realm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't even protect
a single person!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why am I such a coward and a liar?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why am I so helpless!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Master...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see you're awake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
.....!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get up. We're ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get up?	What are
you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no reason for me to listen 
to you anymore. <Marian> is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> is alive and well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You're very fortunate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got something I
need you to do for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I decided to let <Marian>
live a little longer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So it's true, <Marian> is still alive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Believe it or not, I'll let 
you do what you want.
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
