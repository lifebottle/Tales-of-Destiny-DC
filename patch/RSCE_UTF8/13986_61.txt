a favor to ask you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I... I want you to hit me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If I take a punch from
THE <Kongman>, I can 
brag about it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir, I'm sorry.
I can't do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm... only going to use these fists
of mine to protect everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
And so...!
[ENDBLOCK]

Whaaat!? Was it

[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you from this city, miss?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nope. Why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a... problem
I need help with.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! A damsel in distress?
Come on, come on, let's
hear it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I'll tell you, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, I have a
younger brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? Well, okay. Go on.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I overheard Mom
and Dad talking about him...
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
About how he might not
be my real brother...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really, now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, let me tell you this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if it's not by blood,
he's still your brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't really get it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh. It's kinda tough, eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp, guess it's yours 
to worry about now!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so mean, miss!
I'm already worried!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey sis!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you okay? Are you
hurt or anything?
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. My brother and I were fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, I thought about what 
you said, and I get it now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well now, you're pretty
smart, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I was more worried about my brother
than myself when I was running from
the monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
This means we're really
family, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you got it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
See? You're not related by blood,
but you're still family!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
Older Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks, miss!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, don't mention it.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Be good to each other, yeah?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you from Calvalese?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I am. No need
to whisper.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well? Gonna make
fun of me or what?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
No, truth is...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

he's doing well there.

What are you doing

I see, the village chief's daughter and
this boy were exchanging letters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. This is the first
time we've met, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So he mistook
<Philia> for you.
[ENDBLOCK]

So, let's go somewhere

[ENDBLOCK]
Sure. We don't want to

Well, a long time ago,
she told me that she
liked me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, uh, Mr. <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
G-Girls tend to forget
the past and move on...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
B-But boys seem 
to always h-hold
onto it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
T-This behavior by men is commonly
di-disliked by wo-women...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I see. I won't care
about it at all then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, no, but... girls
hate that, too...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh... Did you wanna 
stop looking for the 
Legendary Carrot?
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep looking for the carrot
Give it up

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew, I'm glad...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was afraid you were gonna
up and abandon me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let's go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was only for a little
while, but I had fun...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... Goodbye, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much for coming
with me on my errand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, just tell me one
thing, would you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just what exactly do you intend to
do with that "Legendary Carrot?"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm gonna smack my big bro
upside the head with it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Upside the head?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! I'm VERY
angry at him!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
He just up and left us one
day without saying a word!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if he comes crawling back,
I'm not gonna let him off easy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Well, be careful
not to accidentally
kill him, I guess...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got a real harsh mouth, but
you're actually a really sweet guy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph... Don't say
such dumb things...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need to go. I have something
I need to do here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, wait...!
[ENDBLOCK]

tell me your name...

Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you're that arena fighter.
Mr...Kong...Guy...was it?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe it's because there are so many

That's what dad said,
so it must be true!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
He said that this city

of Seinegald.

[ENDBLOCK]
Whoo! POW!

You guys really did it!
I can't wait to tell dad!

[ENDBLOCK]
The natives of this city were
undignified savages.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Eek! Help me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you're not
a monster...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see what you can
do to those savages!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I know it wasn't that savage
muscle guy from the arena 
who kept the peace here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
All cities are the same
when attacked from
above like that...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Will humanity have no
choice but to perish?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought the day would
come when I would be working
with the natives of this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The Oberon Corporation is
responsible for the rapid
growth of this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I got separated from my
child. I hope she's okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone from this city
might have been leading
those ruffians!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Ms. <Ilene> hasn't been
around for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried... That armada was
nothing compared to this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I miss the blue sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope one day I can walk in the
sunshine with my daughter again.

[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know what Softy Kreem is?
It's the specialty of this city.

[ENDBLOCK]
Mommy!?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
When I tell mom that the <Kongman>
protects the city, she gets really
mad.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that a lotta people are
suddenly complaining about the
Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a shadow in the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
If it's always nighttime,
I won't have to worry
about sunburns, right?

Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The climate is nice, and there
is so much to do. This city is
a great place to live.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope this will be a good opportunity
for the residents to get to know each
other a little better.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
As the gap between rich and
poor grew in size, so too did
the animosity the people felt
towards Oberon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure Ms. <Ilene>
is disappointed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It's times like this that
we need to unite...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Without Ms. <Ilene>, it would
be very difficult.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted to show Ms. <Ilene> that
I was working with the residents
of the poor district.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
If you leave Neustadt and
head north, you will find a

[ENDBLOCK]
Don't talk to me in

[ENDBLOCK]
Go for that sun!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
When the sun goes out
of sight, it's a race!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Race so we can see the sun!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You should race that kid. If you
think that's all he is, you're in

[ENDBLOCK]

monsters into the arena!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh no, we've got
to get back!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>

Since we've come all this way
to Neustadt, why don't we say
hello to <Ilene>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
She may not be there...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We passed through this city
on the way to Lienea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> hasn't been seen
in public for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if she's
gone somewhere?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We don't have time for a
detour. Let's head for the port
and get on the boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a magnificent town. There are
so many big, beautiful buildings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the Oberon Corporation's
funding, it looks like this place
has grown quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea it was
this developed...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, did you think
it was all rural?
[ENDBLOCK]

Wh-What? I...!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sorry, <Stahn>.

[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Bacchus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a childhood friend from Lienea.
Wow, what a coincidence!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came to Neustadt to shop, but I
never thought I'd meet you here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
You took off so suddenly.
It kicked up a huge fuss.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh? Well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
In other words, you ran away from
home. You really are something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, shut up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, uh, when are you coming
back to the village?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm probably not
coming back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something I have
to do, no matter what.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't tell you the details, but
I just can't go home yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez, fine. If you put it
that way, I won't pry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you should at least write 
a letter to your family. <Lilith> 
is worried, you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll be going now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, see you around.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't want to needlessly
worry them, so I kept quiet
about <Greybum>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was the right choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, where did <Mary> go?
[ENDBLOCK]

Why'd you go
get one alone!?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It was yummy...
[ENDBLOCK]

What are you laughing about
at a time like this, Chal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
 Oh, no, nothing. You're right.
I wonder where everyone went?

<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm also worried about <Ilene>.
Hopefully she's all right.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> just left for the arena
with a group of people I've
never seen before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really!?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I wouldn't lie to you about
that. Can I go now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Do you think the people with <Ilene>,
are <Stahn> and the others?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's something to hope
for. All right, let's head 
for the arena.
