[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister...? What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!? Don't startle me like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's got you so nervous?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you here to
see the mayor?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Shh, not here. Let's
talk at the orphanage
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Come with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Want me to come, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, tell us what's going on.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the kids at the orphanage
are going to put on a play, soon...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that got to do
with the mayor?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, I'm getting to that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
You know this already, <Rutee>,
but the mayor and his wife 
aren't exactly fond of this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not much of
a secret here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the two of them will
be attending the play.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm hoping that the children's
performance changes their
minds about the orphanage...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
But... I suspect that the
mayor's wife is trying
to sabotage us...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you were going to go
to the mayor about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Mhm. I don't know
what I'd say, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you can't exactly just
waltz in and ask them "Are
you trying to sabotage us?"
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I have a favor
to ask, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you find out what the
mayor's wife is planning?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you and
<Rutee> discussing?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing. Nothing at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I need your
help with something,
if you don't mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I'll be right there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
This will be our little secret.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for taking
care of this for me, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Hey, wait a sec...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now what do we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, guess we should start by
going to the mayor's house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shh! Can't you hear voices
from inside the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're right! I do
hear something...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't make out what
they're saying, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! What's with that
stupid grin on your face?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was just thinking... This
totally makes us spies!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, grow up...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Still, if you were a spy, you'd
be able to hear them, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Philia>？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you hear that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, there are voices
coming from inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't make out what
they're saying, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah... If only we could-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shh! I'm trying to listen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>? You can
understand them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>.
Shut up!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I also need you
to be quiet, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can hear a woman's voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That must be the mayor's wife.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The play...prepared...
The orphanage...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...will be crushed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is she up to...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry.
I couldn't make that out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry guys, but I'm gonna need
us to see this through to the end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to protect the orphanage at
all costs. I can't let the mayor's
wife get away with this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. So the mayor's wife
is planning something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, but I don't
know exactly what...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry... If only
I could have...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Come, now. Don't be
so hard on yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
A lot of people will come to the
play. They won't be able to get
away with anything rash.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be there, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. If they try
anything funny,
we can stop them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then. The play is tomorrow.
Feel free to rest here overnight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They still haven't started...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. I'm sure the children just
need more time to get ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
By Atamoni, the children are gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where could they have gone!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know! However,
they were just here a
short while ago...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
They couldn't have gone far.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Is everything all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, the children are gone...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, dear, how unfortunate!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't give me that! You had
them kidnapped, didn't you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you accuse me!
I'm the mayor's wife!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
What a rude young lady.
You clearly didn't have
a proper upbringing!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yes, I forgot to tell
you, by the way...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
If today's play happened to be a
failure, we'd have no choice but
to cut funding to the orphanage!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't be serious!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
This can't be real!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way! You can't do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, how forgetful of me. Sorry,
it must have slipped my mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm looking forward
to the play. Ohohoho~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's clearly involved.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Forget it for now. The play's
due to start at any minute.
We have to hurry!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Their costumes aren't
in the orphanage.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
It's possible they're out in
the town still wearing them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Got it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's split up. Between the
four of us, we should be
able to find them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No...No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
They didn't come back in time...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Alas, what a shame!
Ohohoho...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the orphanage
shuts down, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Fear not! Once we knock this
eyesore down, we'll replace it with
the most exquisite art gallery! 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't even joke about that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't matter what you say.
There is no place for you here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all our fault... If only we
weren't playing hide-and-seek...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No! Don't blame yourselves!
It's not your fault at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>, does this mean
we're going to lose our home?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
No! I want to stay
with everyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, what are you saying?
Everything'll be fine!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if there's no orphanage,
you'll get by just fine as long
as you stick together!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, there are some things that
you can't do on your own, but
together you can do anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, we're
a family, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
There, you see? Let's believe in
the sister's words, all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah! All I need's my family!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Me too!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Enough with this pathetic
"happy family" charade!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
I suggest you make
yourselves scarse, now!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
That's enough, dear.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What are you
saying, honey?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I know this place upsets you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
In fact, I feel the same. It hurt
us both to see this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is, we love children.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're really
gonna stand there
and lie like that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not lying. More than anything,
we wanted a child of our own.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
However... The goddess
never saw fit to bless us so...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever I saw a child who was
abandoned like these orphans...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't help but expect them
to be no better than the
parents who left them here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
We have no right
to have a family!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's my fault, however.
My fault for allowing my
prejudice to get so bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Honey...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not going to bother
you anymore. You are
free to remain here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, dear.
Let's go home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, Mr. Mayor...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me say something.
You said you didn't
deserve to have a family?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if you really believe
that, then maybe we don't
deserve a family, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Despite that... Well,
here we are. Together.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you
trying to say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm saying you can visit
us whenever you want.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
You'd trust us with these children?
Even after what we tried to do to you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I think we can let that
slide... Under one condition.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
...One condition?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
You must promise to truly
be a part of our family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
True family forgives each other, no
matter what. You know that, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll all be their
real children. Not
just acting!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
She's my new mom!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, new mom!
Let's go and play!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The sisters are at home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you're back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay safe, Miss <Rutee>！
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay safe!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Miss <Rutee>!
I knew you'd come back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm gonna miss you, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I promise I won't cry anymore.
I believe in you, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I promise I won't cry anymore. I'll
work hard, just like Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, let's play!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
Be careful!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>! Why is
the sky so weird?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, what's wrong with the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be fine. You don't
have to worry about us!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah...! Help me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! Back off!
That's my family!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you guys okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
We are, thanks
to you, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
But...but...!
[ENDBLOCK]
I was so scared!
[ENDBLOCK]
Waaah! My promise!
[ENDBLOCK]
I promised Miss <Rutee> that I
wouldn't cry so she wouldn't worry!
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't...I gotta...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, everyone...
I know you were scared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But you're okay now.
I promise, as long as I'm
around, nothing'll ever get you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>,
what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
You look really sad...
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey you! Did you make her sad!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Is someone bullying you? Did they
do something to hurt you?
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm here for you. Don't be sad!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm...
I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because of people
like <Lion> and <Hugo>
that the world is like this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...But because of them,
I was able to come
back to you all...
[ENDBLOCK]
So because of people like them,
we're still alive, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
No fair! I was gonna say that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Then we should thank them.
Thank you, you two.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah... I guess you're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'd be real
happy if they heard you say that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We've received a message!
[ENDBLOCK]
Darilsheid is under
attack from an army of monsters!
[ENDBLOCK]
Our forces are holding them back,
but they won't last forever!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, we need your help!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must return to Darilsheid. We
cannot let that city fall.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... We can't just
leave Cresta like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll move the troops
stationed at the
Phandarian border to this town.
[ENDBLOCK]
It will take some
time for them to arrive...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'll stay here until then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, but could
you guys go on without me?
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay, Miss <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, we'll be all right!
You need to hurry to Darilsheid!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh...?
[ENDBLOCK]
You're not just our
big sister now, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
You gotta save the people
in Darilsheid just like you saved us!
[ENDBLOCK]
Only you can
do that, right,
Miss <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you... You all have
given me the strength I needed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>, I know you can do it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys are the best!
You're my little angels!
With you guys in my corner,
I can take on the world!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that settles that.
I'm going with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
We will defend the city at all costs
until our reinforcements arrive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right!
We're counting on you!

<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.

notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
