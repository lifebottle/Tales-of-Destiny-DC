[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni..!
More glamorous than ever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you seen this land?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
A beautiful lush green world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the true nature of the
heavenly realm. It cannot be
compared to the filthy earth!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
My brothers... Soon the resurrection
of the heavens will be upon us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The world belongs to everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't let this fake earth you've
created take all of it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
The people of the earth are talking...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's end this. Who shall prevail...
the celestials or the earthlings?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's settle this once and for all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go, <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is ridiculous...
That I, the King of Heaven...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, <Miktran>?
This is our true power.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will not be defeated. I'm not going
to lose to the likes of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eye of Atamoni! Give me your power!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's..! Are you trying to do
the same thing as <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know the consequences!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fine...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will not lose to you
foolish earthlings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
True prosperity can only achieved
when led by a supreme being!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does that mean you're going to reign
over this world as an equal to Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's none of your business!
We don't need you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni should be a natural
presence in the human heart.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will decide our own future,
walking with our own two feet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the happiness and joy 
we live for in this world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't need you to tell us what to do!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
You impudent...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
With Atamoni's true power,
you will be punished by the gods!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell is that light?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, and the other masters 
as well, do not be afraid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
We'll be right by your side.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take care of it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Trust in what we've built up so far!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, of course I believe you.
I believe in all of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've tasted the bitter and
the sweet together, we're
irreplaceable partners.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're all of the same mind.
We're doing this together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, let's end it all, this time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We did it... We finally did it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's over...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no sign of <Miktran> anywhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've won, haven't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohhhh, yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're safe now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>...
I'm glad...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like I could write
the best song ever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now all we have to do is 
get the Eye of Atamoni...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this shaking?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
No...! Perhaps Dycroft 
has begun his descent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we don't destroy it, the entire outer
shell will crash into the ground...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, the entire hull?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're done for! We did all
this for nothing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can't you do something about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm afraid we're going to 
have to make a last stand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...all of you, we need to talk.
Get in front of the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The's only way to stop it... we need
to destroy the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can do it now.
Trust us...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll explain the procedure briefly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, we must pierce the Eye of 
Atamoni with our four Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We then vibrate our core crystal and
the Eye of Atamoni in resonance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It will destroy the Eye of Atamoni
from within. And in a chain reaction, 
disintegrate the outer shell as well!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Without the Eye of Atamoni, 
it would be impossible to 
maintain the outer shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
This way, we can stop the
damage to the surface.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> and the others, after piercing
the Eye, leave here immediately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
When the Eye of Atamoni is
destroyed, a tremendous amount
of energy will be released.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to blow up Dycroft 
with the Eye of Atamoni...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a minute. So you guys are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's goodbye forever, I guess.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the only way.
You must understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You never told
us about this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
To keep us from changing our minds...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, you can't do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've come this far, and at
the last minute, there's no 
way that's possible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go back to the surface
together! There's got to be 
something else we can do!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...yeah, you big idiot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're slowing down my resolve, 
and it could destroy the earth!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a Swordian master, you must 
do what must be done <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damnit...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...let me go first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My time with you has been short,
but you have served the royal 
family well until now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Igtenos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Glory to Phandaria.
Best wishes to you, <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will never forget what 
you have taught me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much, <Clemente>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Live well, <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come to think of it, you and I have
known each other a long time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for everything, <Atwight>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was fun, it was like having
a sister. I hope you stay that 
way forever, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I no longer have anything to say...
I believe in you!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
