<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni! It's glowing
more brightly than ever before!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Er'thers! Do you see
what I have created?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
This world is a paradise!
Lush, and brimming with
life!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such is the true nature of the
Aethersphere! Your disgusting
Earth could not hope to compare!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
My people will soon awaken from
their slumber. The resurrection
of the Aetherians is at hand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our world belongs to everyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your "paradise" is nothing but a fake!
You won't take any more of our Earth!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damned Er'thers, of course
you would resist me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
So be it. Aetherians, or Er'thers...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let us settle once and for all...
Which of our races shall perish!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go, <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-Impossible! I am the
king of the Aetherians!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You see, <Miktran>?
This is our true power.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I refuse to fall here! The likes
of you will not stop me!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eye of Atamoni...! All of your
power... Grant it to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's...! Is he trying to do
the same thing as <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Surely he knows what will
 happen if he does this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh no!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Filthy Er'thers.
I won't lose to
you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I shall lead this world
to true prosperity as
its supreme ruler!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you intend to rule
as if you were a god?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Screw off! The last thing the world
needs is a tyrant like you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni lives in the hearts of
the people! Not through you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll decide our own future!
We'll get there on our own!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the true joy
of being alive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't need you to
tell us what to do!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Impudent little...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni's 
power shall plunge you
into eternal damnation!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that light?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Stahn>, everyone else,
do not be afraid!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Indeed. We're right here
at your side.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll get through this together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Trust in the bonds we've made!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Of course we believe in
you. We believe in all of you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've been together through
the good and the bad. We're
inseparable!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're all of the same mind.
We're doing this together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes! Let's put an end to
this! Once and for all!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-We did it...
We really did it!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's over.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no sign of
<Miktran> anywhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've won, haven't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
OH YEAH!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a relief.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>...
I'm so happy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I reckon I could write a
masterpiece about this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now all we gotta do is deal
with the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What's this shaking?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>No! Dycroft is beginning to fall!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>If we don't destroy it, the entire
Aethersphere will crash into the ground!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? The whole thing!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're done for! We did
all this for nothing!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can't we do anything about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It's come to this, then.
We'll have to use our last resort.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
   Everyone, listen carefully.
Take us to the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>There's only one way to
stop this. We need to destroy it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Destroy it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We can do it now.
Trust us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll explain what you have to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>First, you must pierce the Eye with
all four of us Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We will then vibrate our core
crystals against the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It'll be destroyed from within,
and the resulting chain reaction
will break up the Aethersphere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Without the Eye, the Aethersphere
will be unable to hold itself together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>This way, we can stop it
from destroying the surface.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Stahn>. Once we're in, you must
all immediately leave this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>When the Eye of Atamoni is
destroyed, a tremendous amount
of energy will be released.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Both Dycroft and the Eye will
be completely destroyed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait! You guys
aren't going to...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
This means goodbye, for good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It's the only way.
Please, you must understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why didn't you tell
us about this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
To prevent us from
changing our minds...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No! You can't do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've come this far together!
It can't end like this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going back home together!
We'll find a way! There has to
be another way!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Listen to me you utter fool!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you waver here, the
Earth will be destroyed!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
 <Stahn>! You're a Swordian Master!
You know what must be done! Do it!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'll go first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our time together was short,
but in that time, you served
my family well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Igtenos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Glory to Phandaria. I know
you will lead it to prosperity.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will never forget
what you taught me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll miss you, <Clemente>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Live well, <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'know, you and I have been together
ever since I can remember...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Atwight>. Thank
you for everything...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I enjoyed our time together.
It was like having a little sister.
I hope you never change, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is nothing more for
me to say. I believe in you.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
