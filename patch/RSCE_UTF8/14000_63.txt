<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a pretty stubborn guy. Now
cough it up! Tell us what you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh! I dunno nothin'!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, any more than this will...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...what are you doing?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a typical interrogation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Typical?? <Batista>'s
covered in wounds!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm doing
what's necessary.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>, please. Please
tell us where <Greybum> is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the indecisive <Philia>'s
ordering me around, now?
You're pretty full of yourself, huh?  
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. I'll tell you something,
for old time's sake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
We didn't come here
just to attack the town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Speaking of which, that one ship
from the armada, could it be...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way, could <Greybum>
have been on that ship?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to see what's right under
your nose, as they say! Even if you
realize it now, it's too late!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...We're getting nowhere...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...Fine. If that's
how he wants it...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, I'm putting
your tiara on <Batista>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're taking it off...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, you don't
want him to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's so cute...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd feel bad forcing her to do it, 
so why not take mine instead?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, right. It's because
you don't trust me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no interest in 
dressing like a woman.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see you keep that
tough-guy act going after this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
UGWAAAAH!!!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ggh...Heh...is...
...that all ya got...??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, you're being a 
little unreasonable!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. That's enough for now.
We'll continue this tomorrow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>...
Why are you doing this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>, I've brought
you breakfast.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? The door...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
B-<Batista>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>'s gone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. When I came up here,
the door was open.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it locks from the outside,
so how did he...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm thinking he might have
had some connections.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, this is bad. 
Someone let <Batista> out!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did you say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
During the night, I silently
unlocked the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then you let him go with the
intention of watching his movements?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what the tiara is for.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I get it, since there's a tracking
device in it... right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, where is <Batista>...?

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
