Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh!? Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, you guys are not
from Cavalese are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll find out
why soon enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Go home! All you damn foreigners
must get out of here right now!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's bad enough that you're in my city,
now you're trying to take Elena away!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, What's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry if we offended you.
But now is not a good time...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
They're the ones who
should be apologizing!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma and Grandpa, stop it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
If these people can't be
here, then what about me...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know what you're talking
about! Do what you want!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, excuse me, but
what was this about...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, half of my blood
is the same as yours.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
My mother's from Calvalese
and my father from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now I understand, where
are your parents now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
My mother died of an illness
a long time ago. My father is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! I know this is sudden,
but I need a favor from you guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I think my father is still alive
and probably in Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
If you ever see him,
tell him this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell him that his daughter Elena
wants to live with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, yes of course.
It's no problem.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sick of it. I hate
my grandfather and
grandmother.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
All they keep saying is that those
with foreign blood can't be trusted.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
If he sees someone from Seinegald, he'll
compare him to my father and vilify him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
He also blames my father for my
mother's death... even though it
wasn't his fault...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Just the fact that I'm related
to those two makes me sick!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's ok, I've heard enough...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I know it's
none of your business.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
If you ever meet my father, please
remember what I told you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
My father's name is Nash.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash...! What are YOU doing here!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Dad!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey... Can I come live 
with you in Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena... I can't do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
...What?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena, you're not going
to be happy with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Why's that? Do you also think 
you're the reason why mom died...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the truth.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true. 
Mom died because of...
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Since you mother was married
to a Seinegaldian man, the people
began bullying her constantly...
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
So if you come stay with me, a Seinegaldian,
you'll surely have a terrible life too...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
So, if I go to Seinegald...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
If we Calvalesian go, 
we'll meet with a much worse fate.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, father-in-law. 
I'm sorry for putting you
in such a terrible situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it.
I did it all for her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
What... do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
In order for you to be happy...
you had to hate the Seinegaldians.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why, he's been doing this...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well, then, I suppose
that plan failed...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
It's nonsense to hate your
blood family because of
where they come from.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I love both Calvalisians
and Seinegaldians.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
...I couldn't leave this
country without you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Somehow, I've managed to get a job at
the Oberon Corp. in branch in Cherik.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't live with you yet, but I'd be happy
to come and see you once in a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course it is.
Right, dear?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. You are my son, even though
you're my technically my stepson...
[ENDBLOCK]
Nash
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you... so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elena
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to visit you too.
With Grandma and Grandpa, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, I guess
we can leave now. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right.

Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the mayor of this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's my mission to rid the
city of all foreigners!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's truly Seinegaldian to enter
a man's home this late at night!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
You have no business here.
Get the hell out of here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
You're dressed like... a foreigner!
Don't you dare come into my house!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
The truly gifted, the chosen ones,
that's what we Calvalese people are!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
After a thousand years of hard
work, our time has finally come!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying that we can't become
inhabitants of the new world...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not approving of foreigners.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
You can have the lens.
When you're done, get
the hell out of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
People in this country are poor,
but we all help each other get by.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a virtue of the Calvalese to be
compassionate to their fellow man.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, you'd better
get out of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened to Seinegald?
What's Belcrant...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Are the rumors of junkland's
disappearance true?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
In fact, it was my husband who was the
most enthusiastic about collecting lens.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
