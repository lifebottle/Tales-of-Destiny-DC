<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, there you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<IGNORE>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did everyone leave already?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah... You should 
have said farewell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not good with goodbyes.
Well. I'd better get going, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that <Hugo> has paid me, I'm 
going to take it easy for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have to hustle and 
bustle to collect lens anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Say, where in Seinegald is
your hometown?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a small town called Cresta.
It's actually not too far from here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, neat. I'll visit you next time I go...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Never visit me under any circumstances.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you understand me? Promise me! 
If you go there then I’m through
with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, I told you before that back home
there were people waiting for me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, it's not just one or two.
There's a whole bunch of them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'see I'm from an orphanage.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
An orphanage that's full 
of little kids.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're waiting for me 
to earn money for them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's why you're so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a real tearjerker!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heehee, Gotcha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
... Wha? You were just pulling 
my leg?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Duh. Don't you think that
story is a little too good 
to be true?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But! ...Man I'm such a sucker.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You should learn to be a little 
more suspicious of people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, there you have it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let it go so easily!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Going on this trip with you
wasn't so bad. This is for real,
for real.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah. I had a lot of fun too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I guess that's how 
special you are to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha, I'm aware.
You're so naive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're messing with me again! Enough!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Stahn>, it's time to go...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Oh, yes.
I'm going to go now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know I won't see you again, 
but take care. Give my best 
to your family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, take care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, then!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
