[ENDBLOCK]
You are!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see ...who was it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I've been
forgetting things 
a lot lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
No problem. My name
is <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's the same name
as Shiden's mucisian son.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, what can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been looking for something, 
have you ever given away an 
instrument in the mortuary before?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I asked Mr. Ferryman for
it before and he gave it to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, I came here to see if you
could give me that instrument.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I was actually given 
that instrument to another man.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The man had a talent for music.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So, the man has the instrument.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the man's name?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? What was it? At my age,
I tend to forget things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's a problem.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have a choice. There's
nothing more we can do. Let's
just go back to my place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right.

floating in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
We're gonna be okay, aren't we?
We're gonna be okay, right? Hey!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius> has fallen, but
there's a lot of work ahead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
The people of Moreau will never
forget the humiliation of having
their land trampled upon...
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't like to say it, but his
whole mess is going to deflect
the people of Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't blame Moreau
or Terazzi anymore...
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald is collecting all the lens.
Are we sure we can trust that country?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, heroes!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurray for Terazzi,
hurray for Terazzi!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Mom and Dad said it's going
to be a great place to live.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The roof in the sky～♪
is full of holes～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
What will happen to the sun
when the roof in the sky closes?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens, lens, lens～♪
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that the new lord of Moreau
and the young lord of Shiden, fought
together to defeat His Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope they'll take this opportunity
to get along with Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A war between Heaven and Earth?
We don't want to fight anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't stop worrying about
my grandchildren's future.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Times have changed since we
started working with Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
For the sake of my grandson's
future, I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Aych-cha...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's rumored that the third son
of the Shiden clan is going to
be the lord of Terazzi.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Who was running the broadcast?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Wonder if I'm going to die without
knowing the outside world...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice to meet you, guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty, must have been
thinking about this country
in his own way.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
But the conquest of Moreau
was too much. We lost the
hearts of the people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what will happen to 
Terazzi now that His Majesty
the Great is gone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
A Belcrant's blow, what
does it mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky has been completely blocked...
I can't believe this is peoples work.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If it was made by men, there's no
reason why people can't destroy it.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
