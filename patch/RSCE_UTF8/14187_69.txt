Sorry, memory ain't

[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
No problem. My name's <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Really...? That's the same name
as Shiden's youngest prince.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, what do you want?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm looking for something.
Have you ever acquired an
instrument from Moreau?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, I think the ferryman had
asked me to hold it for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came here today hoping you
could give me that instrument.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry. I've given it away
to another bloke.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
He had quite a
talent for music.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll need to ask
him about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Great. What's his name?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
His name...? Sorry, when you reach
my age, you tend to forget things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is hopeless.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is what it is. There's nothing
more we can do here. Let's
just go back to my place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you say so.

<Tiberius> has fallen,

of work ahead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
The people of Moreau won't soon forget
the disgrace brought to their lands...
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
It's terrible. Thanks to this whole
mess, the people of Moreau are
blinded by anger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
Such is the state of affairs
for Terazzi and Moreau...
[ENDBLOCK]

Seinegald is collecting all
the lens for some weapon.
Can they truly be trusted?
[ENDBLOCK]

I hear that the new lord of Moreau and
the youngest prince of Shiden fought 
together to defeat His Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope they seize this opportunity
and repair relations with Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A war between mankind and those
in the heavens? We have no desire
to fight such a war.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Thinking about our grandchildren's
future makes me feel anxious.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Cooperating with Seinegald?
Time's sure are a-changin'.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, for the sake of
our grandchildren, do
what you can.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Steadyyy~
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
There's a rumor that the youngest
prince of Shiden will rule Terazzi.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Who in the world was
behind that broadcast?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if I'm going to die before
I get a chance to explore the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I think His Majesty had his own way
of showing concern for his country.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
But conquering Moreau went too far.
He lost the hearts of the people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
What will become of Terazzi
now that His Majesty is gone?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
A strike from Belcrant...
What's the meaning of this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky has been covered entirely.
How can anyone be capable of this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If it's man-made then it stands to
reason that we can also destroy it.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
