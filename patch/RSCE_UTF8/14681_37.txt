So you've found the [Tin Doll]? I'd
be more annoyed than spooked if
that thing moved around at night.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You found the [Draglue Fruit].
Its juice makes a powerful glue...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If you get any on yourself, you can
get it off by soaking the spot in
warm water overnight.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What a pain...
My hands are all
swollen now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let me share with
you an interesting story...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I hear the citizens of Junkland
brought some thing they found
out in the desert back home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
But it creeped them out so much, they
threw it right back into the desert.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a fruit that grows near
Junkland that the people here
use to make a powerful glue.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
so be careful you don't
touch it by accident.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
