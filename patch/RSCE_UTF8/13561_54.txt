[ENDBLOCK]
Dead...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Who're you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn, this is bad...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...huh, it's you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
It's me, Jobs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! It's the person Young
Master got promoted!
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought I'd see you in a place like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to you, I'm the
head of security here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
But, I didn't receive any messages
that you'd be coming...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs, I have a favor to ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it? If it's a favor from you,
you can ask anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me past that door.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying...
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you doing!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it. There's a difference in
power between us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, Jobs. Leave this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
No. It's better if you leave.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
A person's life hangs in the
balance... even then?
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't forgotten that you're
the one who made me commander.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Even so, I decided to become
a great knight like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
And that's why I can't
let you come any further.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no helping it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You thought you could beat me
with that level of power?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't make me laugh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry... Jobs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no choice but to continue forward.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Who're you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn, a guard's here...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Lion>?
It's you, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
It's me, Will!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! It's the person you escorted
the bishop with, Young Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
How come you're here!?
Wasn't expecting you at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to you, I'm the
head of security here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
But, I didn't receive any messages
that you'd be coming...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will, I have a favor to ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me past that door.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying...
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you doing!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it. There's a difference in
power between us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Lion>...why are you doing this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, Will. Leave this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't throw your life away for
the sake of a mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about? We're on
a mission. We can't just retreat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see you don't want to retreat...
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if I die, my mission
is to protect this place!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's ironic that your last
mission pits you against me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What an idiot...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
For the sake of the mission...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You fought well, Will.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn! If <Marian> wasn't a hostage...
Damn him!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Master... Please
don't give up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can do this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know you don't wish
to hear my voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, but... It's a good thing we're
still together, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
....
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! That's enough, please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're just a kid sulking over
a reality you can't control!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. You're pessimistic
and angry about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't even think, you
just keep on doing the same thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You won't be able to help
<Marian> like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Think about it, Young Master.
There's still a possibility, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
A possibility... What do
you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've come this far. I'm not going to
think about <Dymlos> and the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we are together,
nobody can beat us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
.....That's right, we'll
 rescue <Marian> for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
