[ENDBLOCK]
Dead...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Who goes there?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn, there's
still someone here...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
It's me, Jobs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! It's the soldier you selected
for promotion, Master <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought I'd see
you in a place like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to you, I'm the
head of security here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
That's weird though, no one
told me you'd be comin' by...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs, I have a
favor to ask you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it? If it's you askin',
I'll do it. I owe you big, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please let me
past that door.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? What are you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What are you doing?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop. You won't
stand a chance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, Jobs.
Just leave...
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
No way. You're
the one who should leave.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone's life is on the line.
You still won't move?
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the reason I was promoted.
I ain't ever gonna forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Even so, I also decided I'm
gonna be a great knight like you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
And that's why I can't
let you go any further!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I have no choice...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You really thought you
stood a chance against me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't...make me laugh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Forgive me, Jobs...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no other choice.
I have to keep going.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's there?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn, a guard's here...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Lion>?
It's you, isn't it?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
It's me, Will!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! It's the person you escorted
the bishop with, Master <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you doing here?
I wasn't expecting you at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to you, I'm the
head of security here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
But like I said, nobody told
me you'd be visiting, tonight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will, I have a favor to ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me past that door.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? What are
you talking about...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What!? Stop!
What are you doing!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't. You won't
stand a chance.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Lion>...why are you doing this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, Will. Leave this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't throw your life away
just for the sake of the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying? I'm not
backing down. I have a job to do!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
As I thought...you won't run...
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
My duty is to guard this place,
even if it costs my life!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...In the end, your sense of
duty was your downfall...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...idiot.
For the sake of the mission...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm proud of you, Will...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
If <Marian> wasn't a hostage...
Damn him!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>...
Please don't give up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can do this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know you don't wish
to hear my voice right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...but still! It's a good thing we're
still together, right??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
....
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! That's enough, please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're just a kid, sulking over
a reality you can't control!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You heard me! You're doing nothing
about this situation but moping about it!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Without even considering the consequences,
you've been allowing them to control you!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll never' be able to save
<Marian> like that!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Think about it, Master <Lion>.
There's still a chance, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
A chance... What do
you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've come this far. Forget about
<Dymlos> and the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we are together,
nobody can beat us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You're right. You and me.
We'll rescue <Marian> for sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
