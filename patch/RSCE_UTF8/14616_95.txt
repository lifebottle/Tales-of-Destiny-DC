<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is that thing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excellent. That's the Aeth'er Cruiser
we've been searching for.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold, if you please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you an Oberon executive?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
The name is Shane <Rembrandt>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've met some of you before
at Master <Hugo>'s mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's where...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is a guest in that vessel.
An important guest entrusted
to me by the Young Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must request you
give up the cruiser.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean <Marian>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you call her a guest
when you've taken her hostage?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's still a guest, regardless
of the circumstances.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Rembrandt>!
Why are you doing this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Hugo>'s desires are mine
as well. I hope that answer is enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, a blind follower.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you're crazy, man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Say what you will, but I will not
tolerate any more interference.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to rescue the
hostage. <Chelsea>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Master <Hugo>'s desires aren't
the sole reason I fought you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, I'm a parent myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Could it be...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>, whom you killed in
Helraios, was my daughter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, <Ilene>...
I couldn't avenge you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, keep your spirits up.
We ain't done nothing wrong.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
The hostage has been rescued!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go, <Stahn>.
We've got work to do, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right...
Thanks, <Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
No sweat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you're okay, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you all for your help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, um...
Emi, I mean <Lion>, is he...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>. you... Are you going
to tell this woman the truth?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion> had other things to do.
We're not together right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that right...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, but! He's fine.
I'm sure he's doing fine...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope <Lion> didn't choose the
wrong path because of me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
In his eyes, I closely resembled
his dead mother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that I'm a lot
like... his mother, Chris.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such a person as myself could
become a weakness for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't help but worry that he
would lose his way because of me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before that could happen, I thought
it might be better to take my own life...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion> knew exactly
what he was doing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He did the right thing because he
cared about us, cared about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So don't tell me you're gonna die.
...For his sake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
*crying*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't cry, <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know, I know.
But... but...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's send <Marian> to the surface.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's an escape pod here.
You might want to use it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay. <Marian>, come
over here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much
for everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry if I'm wrong, but
are you... <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, I thought so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had heard a lot about you from
Master <Lion>. You two must have
been very close.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah. He's my
best friend.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure Master <Lion> will
be pleased to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do when
you get back to Earth?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I'll be awaiting <Lion>'s
return at the mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what we, the servants,
are supposed to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now... if you'll excuse me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This was ...good, wasn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Alright.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Finally, all that's left is Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get the cruiser and neutralizers
ready. Let's go now!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani>
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles.
The first is to [Set your title and
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,
and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
