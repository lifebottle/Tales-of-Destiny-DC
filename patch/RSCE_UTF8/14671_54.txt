[ENDBLOCK]
...<Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must apologize to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
For what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Up to now, all I've done is question
whether or not you were ready...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...When in reality, I should have
been asking myself that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the Master and Swordian are
in sync, they are sure to succeed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So if we were the same person,
there wouldn't be any problem?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if that were the case,
our every move would be predictable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, there are times when that
simply doesn't work...like now, for instance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora> must have realised this.
He must have wanted us to strengthen
ourselves more than just physically.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, the same is expected of you,
as well as the other Swordian masters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe he wanted us to reach our
full potential as quickly as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, I've been
thinking about something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the Swordian and the
master are the same person,
that's kinda like 1x1, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So no matter how you do it,
you always end up with another 1.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But if different people
work together, then
the possibilities could be endless!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Between the two of us,
I know we can do this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will overcome
this final trial. Together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I will need your strength. 
Will you fight alongside me, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then it is time...
[ENDBLOCK]
?????
[ENDBLOCK]
...You've done well
to come here, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had a feeling we'd meet
someday. Maybe even like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
?????
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...then there is no need
for me to give you my name.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've a keen eye. Good.
It seems you are prepared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Definitely...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
And what of the
Swordian version of me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no need for you to even ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oho...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Dymlos>.
I am the Swordian wielded by <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
To fight alongside my master. <Stahn>, and
to ensure his victory. That is my proud duty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well said.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I, <Dymlos> Timber,
will judge your worthiness myself!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, show me that you can
defeat me with your combined power!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let us begin!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have fought well...
Victory is yours, this day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like we all
came through, somehow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is nothing left
for you to fear, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have proven yourselves
to be good partners, and an
even better Swordian team.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We entrust
this world to you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
With this power, we ask that
you clear a path to the future!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must now say farewell to you,
our other selves...our dear friends
from a thousand years back...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, <Dymlos>.
You can count on us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will not fail you.
We will fulfill our duty!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
