Hey, you're in command
of the Draconis, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, we are, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a zoologist. I have
a favor to ask you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm researching how this
sky-covered earth is
affecting the ecosystem.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eee-co-system?
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, well... don't worry your
head about the details.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
What I want to find out is:
"The number of birds that
are still out flying around"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You want me to use the Draconis
to count birds? Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Correct. Well, Could you help me?
<TAG_007>Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that's a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you help count birds?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that's a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
I've written out my research methods.
Please read it carefully.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
Count the number of birds flying in the
sky around the world. You'll need to get
on the Avitus Draconis first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
The way to count the number of
birds is simple. When you see a
bird, follow it for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
If you follow a bird for a certain
amount of time, you'll lock on to it.
That means you've counted that bird.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
When doing so, the distance between
the bird and the Avitus Draconis is
important. Whenever possible, chase
the bird directly from behind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
When you successfully lock on,
the current research value will
be displayed in the upper right
corner of the screen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
Please note each bird
only counts once.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
Any flashing birds you find have yet
to be researched. Look for them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you understand everything?
If you want to hear it again or
have finished your research,
please come and see me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
I look forward to
working with you.
[ENDBLOCK]

Rumor about a giant bird
Never mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep me posted.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been waiting for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
According to the data, the number
of birds in the world is <x0E><x08><x00><x00><x80><x17><x71><x46><xDC><x80><x0E><x08><x00><x00><x40>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that was helpful.
Thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
I still need to do more research.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
When you have time, please
continue collecting data.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
This is perfect! Our ecological
research is complete.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just a rumor from the residents,
but I heard that a giant bird was
seen in two different places.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
One was above the islands north of
Lienea. The other over the islands
southeast of Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
Researcher
[ENDBLOCK]
Both birds were flying at a higher
altitude and faster speed than
normal birds. It may be difficult
to find them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! You're just in time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a bad feeling about
this, Young Master...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Same.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, I'm busy. Now
then, if you'll excu-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, don't be like that!
There's nothing to fear!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, over here, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What even is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If this works, your body will undergo
an incredible transformation!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, hope you're ready!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here we go! POWER ON!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
GAHHH!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okaay... annd... stop!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah... Hah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you okay!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Somehow, yeah. What
about you, Chal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Reynolds>, just
what was tha-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*Hic!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you... hiccupping?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yeah, seems like it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*Hic! Hiccup!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woohoo! Success!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What do you me-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HIC!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This time, I've invented a machine
that gives you the hiccups! I call
it the "Hicculationalizer!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
When someone's exposed
to that light, they can't
stop hiccupping!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think?
I'm a genius, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'd better be able to
fix this, <Reynolds>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HICCUP!*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't tell me you want to reverse
the effects already!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lemme at least get some data first!
I wanna see how long it lasts.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've gotta be ki-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HUP*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You had better f-fix this
now or I-I'll...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HURK*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, fine! Put the sword away.
I'm sure I can fix you right up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurry up alrea-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HICC*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. POWER ON!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, time to make some
notes. As expected, even the
mighty Hedge Knight...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...is absolutely adorable...
...when he's got the hiccups.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You! Try saying that aga-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
*HIC*
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looking forward to working with
you on my next experiment, too!

[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to my lab! What

[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
How's the tiara model holding up?
I can't wait to read the report!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, I'm so sorry
for all the trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>, I'm so
glad you're okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do we have any idea what the 
current status is within the 
Aethersphere?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The escape from Radisrol was so
frantic, I haven't been able to...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, there's another reason
I've called all of you here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you take a
look at this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Blueprints for... an Integrated
Lens Cannon?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
In a nutshell, it's a weapon that
fires the combined energy of
a massive amount of lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not as powerful as Belcrant,
but I think it can at least punch
a hole in the Aethersphere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Do you think the facilities
and materials exist on Earth to
accomplish such a feat?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this <Ritora>'s work?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's mine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
While I was working as <Ritora>'s
assistant, I took as many notes
as I could.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though he kept a close eye
on me, I was able to learn a lot.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's incredible, <Reynolds>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
What these "heavenly beings"
are doing is mortifying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The best course of action is to see
to the destruction of Belcrant.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's show <Miktran> what the Earth
dwellers are really made of!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't there anything we can do?
We'll do anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hope... We still
have a chance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I'd like to give you all the
details of the final operation
that <Ritora> had devised.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Final operation?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if we use the Lens Cannon to
punch a hole in the Aethersphere,
we still have other items to resolve.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must ask all of you
to infiltrate Dycroft
once again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Inside, you will take down <Miktran>,
the source of all this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's easier said
than done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We currently don't have the means by
which to ascend to the Aethersphere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
It may be possible to
repair the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we have enough Berselium,
a bio-metallic material.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Berselium is an extremely rare metal.
It's not that easy to find.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any idea
where some might be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I were to hazard a guess, I would
bet there is some within Junkland
in Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... actually...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>There happens to be an ancient
industrial waste deposit site.
If we begin our search there...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can manage that, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if we could fix the Draconis,
wouldn't it still be unable to reach
Dycroft's altitude?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've failed at
that before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wouldn't worry
about that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The weight of the completed Outer
Shell has pushed Dycroft closer
to the Earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
At its current altitude, if
we are able to repair the
Draconis, Dycroft can be
reached.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sure I follow all this
sciency stuff, but I have a
good feeling about this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to start building the
Lens Cannon right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the meantime, I have a
couple of favors to ask
of the Swordian Team.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can we be of assistance?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The first favor is what we
just discussed, repairing
the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The other is of extreme importance,
more important than the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You need to enhance
the Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enhance them...? Is
that even possible?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's an old military research
facility from the last war.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does he mean the Swordian R&D Lab?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>After the war, that place was buried
beneath the earth due to a cave-in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does that research facility still exist?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have already confirmed
its existence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the aftermath of Belcrant's attack,
the facility was unearthed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Could it be...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we utilize the equipment found
within the facility, it should be
possible to enhance the Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...In the truest sense,
enhanced.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the truest sense...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
That concludes the
operational briefing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>In spite of all this adversity,
he could still devise such a plan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>, I'm impressed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's truly a great commander.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you so chipper?
Before, you were all doom
and gloom.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's settled. After hearing this plan,
we have to do it! Don't you agree?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've been able to overcome any
adversity up to this point. We will
most definitely succeed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm goin' with you guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll accompany you
wherever you go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm-hm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It goes without saying,
doesn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay! Next stop is this research lab.
We will enhance the Swordians!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must warn you, it's not so simple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you seriously still
talking like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just when I thought there was a
glimmer of hope. You have to put
a damper on things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, before when you said...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>"If you can't count on me, then you'll
have to train me better."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Were you being sincere when
you said that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course I was.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so rude!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Can I assume that the other three
masters are on the same page?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm-hm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's settled then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>The path is set, we head for
the Swordian R&D Lab.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, the time has finally come.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It would have been better if
this time hadn't come at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>. Why are you so hesitant?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Enhancement in the "truest sense"
isn't just about us Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Indeed. A sword is only as powerful
as the one who wields it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>In other words, our masters must
also be "enhanced" alongside us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
In other words, we must train.
Bring it! We can do anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It's not that simple. It's a
matter of life and death.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Within the lab you will be pushed far
beyond the limits of what you have
overcome until now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>This will be the final trial to
becoming true Swordian Masters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The final... trial...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I know I sound repetitive, but I
have to be sure. <Stahn> Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>In order to overcome the barriers
that stand in your way, do you desire
to become a true master?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course I do. No matter the
obstacle, I will not waver.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good. In that case, I will
be with you until the end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your resolve and determination, that
is why I chose you to be my partner.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>And you three, do you
have any objections?

to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.

to make your status screen look cool!
