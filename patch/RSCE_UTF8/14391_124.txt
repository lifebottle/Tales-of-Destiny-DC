[ENDBLOCK]
That reminds me, <Lilith>'s not back
yet. Wonder where she got off to?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
When I told my granddaughter about
the Legendary Carrot, she dashed
off out of the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
She's probably still somewhere
near Lienea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
The Legendary Carrot is said
to sleep in the forest far to
the south of this village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard a mighty beast
guards the carrot, as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful.

[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care
of <Lilith> for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I used to be a soldier 
of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I reckon my grandkid's out chasing his
dream of following in my footsteps.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If you ever meet him, I hope
you'll take good care of him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
This is your home. Make yourself
as comfortable as you'd like.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope you will all feel at
home here. By all means,
put your feet up.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, follow the path you
believe in. That is the way
of life for an Aileron man!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
From my point of view, <Stahn> is still
a child. Please take good care of him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you have your work
cut out for you. You can't
just sit here and dawdle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, keep <Stahn>
in line, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If you ever get tired,
come back any time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, you've got strong willed
eyes. I know you'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's you again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you come back to visit me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, I gave up looking
for the Legendary Carrot...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... You shouldn't barge into people's
rooms without permission, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet you're hungry. Do you want
me to make you something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you hungry, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm trusting you with the
dinner shopping, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you forget our promise, I'll
never forgive you, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of my brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to worry about
me or grandpa, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of my brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
When it's all over, come back
and I'll make you a feast!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
To tell you the truth, I want my
brother to come home soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big bro! Wake up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmzzz...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You better wake up soon! Your
breakfast will get cold!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhhzzzmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some big brother I have.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guuhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So... you want me to use that
technique that badly?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then you leave me with no choice...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ladle in my right hand!	Frying
pan in my left! Let justice be
done to those who lie in wait!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Howl! The Aileron Family's
Secret Technique:
 "Wake the Dead!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
UWHAOH!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hey <Lilith>.
Good morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's so hard to get you
up in the morning...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry for making you wake
me. Keep up the good work!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you got it!
Leave it to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, hurry up!
Grandpa's hungry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm off to work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm coming with you. If there's
anything I can do to help, just
let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be fine today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to you, I've been able
to get a lot done lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well that's... too bad...
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that you're back from your
travels, you seem to have a lot
of energy left, don't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think so, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, home is where
the heart is, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah... well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, come on. What a 
half-hearted response!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big bro... Maybe you're longing to
go on another trip or something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm? Did you just
say something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Never mind!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't just sit there, if you don't
have anything better to do, you
can help out around the house!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, right. What do
you want me to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I know! You can go shopping
for me. Go get me something to
cook for dinner.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I got this!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Something tells me I'm
going to regret this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big bro! Well? Where's
my ingredients?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A-Agh! Right, sorry!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Check this out! I got us
some Bargain Beef!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well! You actually went
and got something nice, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, <Bacchus> gave
it to me out of the blue...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo! <Lilith>! Did you
get my present?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bargain Beef, straight from
my heart! Think of me when
you eat it! Well, bye!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What just happened?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No clue...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
He sure stressed that
it was a "bargain," too...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ta-daa! Luxury Beef!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? How could you afford that?
I thought you were broke!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it was given to me. It's
from the chief's house!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I know his daughter's
got a crush on you, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...She gave you... beef...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, actually, what happened was...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Then she gave it to me. She
said she was happy to help!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Your face is getting red... Is
your stomach hurting or something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you kidding me!? She gave
it to you because she felt sorry
for you!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What if they get the wrong idea
and think we can't afford food!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? No, they don't think tha-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
They totally do! Aah, I'm so
embarrassed! I will never be
able to show my face around
the village again!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you're worrying
about it too much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You! Take it back to them!
Now! Go! GO! GO! NOW!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, okay!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Go give it back to them right
now! I'm not letting you back
in the house until you do!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big bro, wake up!
You have a visitor!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmzzz...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, it's hard to
wake my brother up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait a moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ladle in my right hand!
Frying pan in my left!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, get up! How can you
be sleeping through all this!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, is he waking up now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought I heard <Dymlos>'
voice just now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That can't be though, right?
Musta just been a dream...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Long time no see, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...? Are you
a dream too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, he's not awake, after all. Let
me handle this. Go to the living
room and take cover!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Secret Technique:
"Wake the Dead!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
UNGWHA!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while, <Philia>.
<Dymlos> and <Clemente>,
too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so glad you came all the
way out here to see me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This isn't the time for small talk.
Something terrible has happened!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, the Eye of Atamoni
has gone missing again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? The Eye of Atamoni!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You don't have to yell.
Calm down, already.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... Didn't they put it in a
special facility or something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Apparently, the Draconis suddenly
attacked and destroyed the facility.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that, the Eye of Atamoni
was simply taken away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Draconis is from Seinegald,
right? I don't understand...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>There are other suspicious
things to consider as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>The location where we sealed
the Eye of Atamoni was known
only to a select few people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>This time, it was probably the work
of someone from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty the <King> has decided
to summon the Swordian Masters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was supposed to pick
you up, so here I am.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, gotcha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll gladly go with you. I 
can't just leave this be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew you would say that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just give me a minute, will you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going away again!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>... The thing is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
We had a deal! You promised you
would never leave me again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I told you before, didn't I?
I was worried sick when
you left, last time!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even so, you're still gonna go!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't care about
me or Grandpa!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true! You and Gramps
are both very important to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But this time... I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We desperately need
your brother's help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's no concern of mine!
Fine. Do what you want!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Big bro, you idiot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh...
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
You're in a bind now, hm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa, I...
[ENDBLOCK]
Go, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
I see it in your eyes. Something
serious has happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Go forth. Do what only you can.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take care of <Lilith>.
Don't worry about her.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, Grandpa. I feel
better hearing you say that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll talk to <Lilith>, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's good to see
you again, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>From now on, I'm going to be tougher
on you than ever. Be prepared for that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the same as always.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, let's get going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, let's go to Neustadt and
take a boat to Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to see
<Woodrow>, aren't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take this with you, big
bro. It'll come in handy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, thanks a lot! You're
pretty nice, after all, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
How else am I supposed
to take care of you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay... fair enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, then, let's go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big Bro! It's morning!
Come on, come on. You...
You're out of bed...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've gotten better at
getting up, huh, big bro?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I didn't want to burden
you forever, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well that's nice... A bit
boring for me, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, besides...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Today's a special day. I needed to
get up much earlier than usual.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...That's right!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope everyone can make it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me too...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you are a young man
of Lienea. When you are tired,
don't hesitate to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while since you came
home. Why don't you rest a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I will.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
EEEEEK!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Lilith>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was someone peeking
through the window!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? Did you
see their face!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
No... I didn't get a very
good look at them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha. I'll go see if I can
find any suspicious people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I brought all the suspicious
people around the house that I saw.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good work, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, confess!
Who was it!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Confess immediately!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're under suspicion
too, you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I am!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got nothing to do with this.
Besides, it was <Bacchus>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea either, but...
It was probably this guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't MEEE!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah, it wasn't <Bacchus>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, <Stahn>!
You understand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that true, big bro?
Well if that's the case...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, the culprit
is in here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you serious!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I-It wasn't me though...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, who the heck peeked
into the bathroom then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Peeked into the...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...Bathroom?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Huh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you show your
true colors!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
True colors...?
So it was this kid?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, this kid's the
perpetrator in the Great
Bathroom Peeper Mystery!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was gathering everyone
up, I didn't dare explain my
reasons for doing so!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Upon seeing <Lilith> angry,
these two reflexively denied
any wrongdoing at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
B-But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
They just knew that <Lilith>
being angry was really bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, give it up already!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this true?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes. I'm the one who peeked
into your bathroom window...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got a real cool big
brother. What's your name?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be sure to remember that
name well! My name is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Just what the heck are
you doing, you idiot!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, anyway, that was really
cool of you, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I was real surprised there.
it's like you turned into a
completely different person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-Nah... I just... was acting
like the main character in a
book I read a long time ago...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the best, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, I'm back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank goodness...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feared you had something to
do with that thing in the sky.
I've been worrying about you
for so long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew... I'm so relieved. You've
come back for good, this time...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, no, I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa will be home soon...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
About that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, right! What do you
want to eat, big bro?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't "Huh?" me. What do you
want for dinner tonight?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to ask me for
anything special today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, I... I still have
things to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
No...
I knew it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since I saw you off,
I knew this would happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, big bro...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So... You're still not
done with your duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So what should you be doing
right now, big bro!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you left, I made
a promise to myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said I wouldn't
sway your decision.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
But most importantly...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said I had to be strong too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Come on, big bro! Swear
to me that you'll do it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll bring the sky back. I promise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear to you, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will become stronger than anyone
else, so my beloved brother can
keep his promise to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big bro, you have to
keep your promise!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You too, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!

Chatty Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well, well they call me, Chatty
Old Man. Nice to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The... Chatty Old Man...?
Well, it's nice to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chatty Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. The opportunity to meet
someone for the first time is a

Well, you still have something
you must do, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wheeeee!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whatcha got there, Jonathan?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if I used a bow, I wouldn't be
able to hit something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if I used a bow, I wouldn't be

If it's about bows, I'm the
girl you need to know!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's this little lady?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>'s really good
with a bow, Gramps!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? Then I have
a favor to ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something caught in the
tree just outside the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If you were to hit a spot close
enough to it with an arrow, I
reckon it'd fall out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I understand.
I think I can do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
There must be something
we can do to help...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry,
Miss <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be right back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that was fast. Are
you done already?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. What's done
is done, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What is THAT?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's an egg!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
This is what was 
stuck in the tree?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It hatched!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eee! It's so cuuute!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's... Kind of creepy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the?
Why me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's not fair, Miss <Lilith>!
I'm the one who found it! Boo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does it think <Lilith>
is its mother?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like you've got someone
to take care of, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehh!? My brother's enough
work for one girl!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, take
it for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, take
it for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
How'd it go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pretty well, actually.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
That's good, but what should
we do with it now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa, could I ask you to
take care of it for a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
You still want to
travel with <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mhm. I'll be sad to part
with this little girl, but..
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I reckon I can consider this cute
little fellow my third grandchild.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you on about, grandpa? If
anything, it's your great-grandchild!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Hohohoh, I reckon you're right;
it's your foster-child, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, grandpa. Where's
the baby dragon?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea
where it went...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to go
look for it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did it leave
by itself?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, it did. I'm
sorry, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was it getting big?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. It had gotten much, much
bigger than when it was born.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess it had to leave
the nest someday...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sad that I won't be able
to see her anymore, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a mother, I should
be happy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the spirit,
<Lilith>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's still too early for
you to leave the nest
though, big bro.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time we see her, maybe
she'll bring her own kids!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, I wouldn't
be able to take care of
them and you two at
the same time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Give me a break...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Hohohoh!<x00>
[ENDBLOCK]
