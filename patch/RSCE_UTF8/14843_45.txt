It has been ages since anyone

<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Great. now monsters talk!?
[ENDBLOCK]
I am a divine being who has watched
over Aquaveil since the dawn of time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? That's amazing.
RIght, where are my manners...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't waste breath on what is
already known to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you really ARE a divine being.
[ENDBLOCK]
Amusing, who knew you
were so witty...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Witty...?
I'm not quite sure what you mean,
but thank you for the compliment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, could you be the spirit that
Franz was talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps we are one in the same.
Now, I would like you to assist
me with something in particular.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure, I'm happy to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
...Over there...
[ENDBLOCK]
It is time to feast!
[ENDBLOCK]
It is as I had suspected,
you hold great power witin you.
[ENDBLOCK]
This was but a test. Now that you
have proven worthy, I must truly ask...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Truly...ask?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since the formation of the
land that covers the sky, the animals
that dwell in Aquaveil have been dying.
[ENDBLOCK]
The smaller, more vulnerable among
them are especially affected. They
grow weaker every passing day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to say another word.
Just leave this to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you certain...?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can count on me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I shall entrust this task to you,
hero of the coming dawn.
[ENDBLOCK]
...Farewell...

Something fun may happen.
