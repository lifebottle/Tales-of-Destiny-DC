I may look like this, but I used
to be a free spirit and traveled
all over the world!

[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone wants to travel in search of
freedom at least once in their life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
From the looks of it, You and
your friends are not free.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
However, it is only in the midst of

Have you found your lucky cat?
I've heard there are strong
genetic factors at play.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a cat with a long history
that was loved by great writers
who loved the sea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you found the sacred tree?
What a small thing we are...
compared to the life force of plants.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Although, I think I would get tired 
of living even if I had a life span
of several hundred years.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So, here's what I've got for you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that there is an
animal in Siden territory
that is loved by sailors.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that it has some
unusual characteristics,
so why not look for it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There is a plant in Sheeden territory 
that is very important to the people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There are markers to distinguish 
them from other plants, so you 
can easily find them.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
