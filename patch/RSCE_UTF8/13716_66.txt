[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe Mr. <Lion>
is leading a rebellion..
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that Oberon's CEO was
the mastermind behind all of this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon's CEO is dead.
Will the battle never end?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Engineers are working tirelessly
to create the lens cannon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Wish there was something
I could do to help..
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Wish everyone in the world
could see that light.
[ENDBLOCK]

Mr. <Lion> how are you doing?
Your success has reached

[ENDBLOCK]
I cultivate the plants
in the courtyard.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I cultivate the plants

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, but I don't know
anything about politics.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If daylight continues to be blocked,
the plants won't last..
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll continue to care for the plants
until the sun shines again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The plants were dying because of
the lens cannon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't help being
disappointed by that..
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
When the king talks about a 
decisive battle, it feels like 
it's finally happening.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cry or laugh, tomorrow
is the last day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tomorrow...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
The day has finally come.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as I'm around, we'll win.
Don't worry. Gahahahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm getting kind of nervous.
Ugh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey. Since we're on a roll,
how about some free time 
until tomorrow morning?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does that mean we're
going to separate?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. In times like these, we all have
our own work to do, don't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
For example, write a letter to those
you left behind in your country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can confess your feelings to 
someone that needs to hear it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I will write a 
letter to my country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will do a victory 
spell for tomorrow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted to take care
of the weapons.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to drink my special stamina
drink and get a good night's sleep.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, come on, are they all 
like that? They're not a very
sexy bunch, are they?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, each of us is free to
do whatever you want.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll go for a little
walk around the area.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, what about you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... I think I'll go to bed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my god, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean... it's night.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's always night now, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The king told said to just sleep it
off and get ready for tomorrow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Get some rest," he said.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah. I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected, the country folk of
Fitzgald are very healthy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you angry about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing. I'm not angry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
As usual, this is nonsense...
Things are all about timing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you don't do what you need to do
when you need to do it, you may never
get another chance, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What we need to do...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that's all I'm going to say
about that. You'll have to figure
out the rest on your own.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's break it up here. Those of
you who feel like resting will go to the
inn. All right?

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters

specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
