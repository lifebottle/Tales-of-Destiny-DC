<TAG_005>There's another photo in
the back of the picture frame.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>It's a rather old photo
of four people togeher.
A family photo...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...This photo's really old.
I can't really tell who it was...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will it really be alright,
leaving things to that man?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
He had a vulgar look to him.
Like he couldn't keep his
greed to himself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is that insatiable greed
that will allow me to
bend him to my will.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
He probably hasn't even realized
that he's already under the
Eye of Atamoni's spell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
What will you do when it is
discovered that the Eye was stolen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Worry not. I will send
out a team from here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You couldn't mean you're sending the boy?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. That way, it will not
be an issue if he is killed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
If, on the other hand, <Lion> is killed,
that will at the very least buy us time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why do you grow so agitated?
Are you worried about your son?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Relax, all you can do is sit
and watch from your seat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just stay quiet and bear witness
to the downfall of your family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That must have been...<Miktran>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'know, it's actually kind of
a relief. The <Hugo> we met
wasn't actually the real <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I can almost
imagine that happy family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it was that <Hugo> that saved us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Master
<Hugo>'s residence.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Please be careful, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Master
<Hugo>'s residence.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome. The Master
is currently out of town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Why did our Master do
something so horrid...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
We would leave the mansion,
but there's nowhere else to go...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> just showed up,
I wonder where she went?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome, sir.
What can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
If you don't keep up...
<Marian> will be very upset.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Have a good day.
I wish you the best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm rooting for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>, will you follow in
your father's footsteps?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
A soldier came by earlier.
Are you on duty again today?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Hugo> sure is busy, huh?
I rarely see him anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Our goal is to be a good and
friendly partner to our customers
in our daily business.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldiers keep questioning us...
What do you think is going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to do with the General!
I really don't know anything about any of this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
If they learn I work for
Oberon, I'm done for...
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't even go outside, I have
to stay inside the mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Most of the lens piled up in the
courtyard of the castle were ours.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Helping out now won't
instantly fix our poor image...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on?
Where is everyone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Something's wrong...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>! I'm home!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a bad
feeling about this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Same...
<Marian>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>!
Where are you?

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
