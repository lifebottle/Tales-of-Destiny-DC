<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
People have realized the CEO
of Oberon is complicit in the
strange events happening all
around the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They've begun protesting
outside of the manor...
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
President <Hugo> is currently
recuperating from a serious
illness.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't believe the rumors
going around. They are not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, that's not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then bring <Hugo> out here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is bad. If this continues
the hunters are going to riot.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you be sure?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Supply and demand for
lens is all out of whack.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It means the lens hunters
will lose all their money.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So they will lose their livelihood.
That's definitely a problem.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But what can be done to fix this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The problem is that Oberon can't
keep up with all the people trying
to sell off their lens in bulk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only these people were
just a bit more patient...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That way, little by little Oberon
could slowly buy up more lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So all we gotta do is calm
these people down?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? What are
you going to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please listen to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I met with President
<Hugo> just yesterday!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He told me himself, though
he's real sick, he'll be back
on his feet in no time!
[ENDBLOCK]
It must be true!
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was there with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
If they are both saying so,
it must be true, yeah?
[ENDBLOCK]
So then... maybe it really
was just a rumor...
[ENDBLOCK]
So it was all a misunderstanding.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe that worked,
but... I'm not a fan of lying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's no big deal. You did what you
had to do. I think it'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried about the rest of the
cities. Let's go check them out.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been in and out of
the mansion a lot recently.
Do you live there?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen Oberon's CEO
or his butler for a while now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the mansion of Oberon's
CEO. Isn't it magnificent?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen Oberon's CEO
or his butler for a while now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The moun... The mountain is gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean to tell me Oberon's CEO
is the mastermind behind this?
You've got to be kidding me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If Oberon is truly responsible,
then the entire company should
be shut down.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that the secret weapon
being built within the castle uses
a lot of lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever I hear the word "lens,"
I can't help but think of the
Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The secret lens weapon has nothing
to do with Oberon, does it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone is relying on you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It has not been publicly disclosed
that Master <Lion> is the CEO's son.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay vigilant and report any
suspicious individuals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Every time I hear about Master
<Lion>'s activities, I want to brag
about him to someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Hugo> is now an important asset
to our country. I am here to ensure
his safety.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been relieved of my duties to
guard <Hugo>'s mansion. This is a
direct order from my superiors.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, out of habit,
I'm still here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It was Mr. <Hugo> who was
broadcasting. As soon as
I heard his voice, I knew.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Betraying one's country is a serious
crime. I'll never forgive <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I was ordered to watch over the
estate. As such, I will not leave
this post.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the
mansion, is waiting for
someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think there's anyone
who would come back to this
mansion now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the
mansion, is waiting for
someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A life free from the influence of
lens. I can't even imagine it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The CEO of Oberon, <Hugo>,
has so many magnificent 
achievements.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
In a former life, before Mr. <Rembrandt>
found me, I was a lens hunter.

Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning!

[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I may still be an apprentice,
but I am eager to assist.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh. I'm still an apprentice...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you hear the latest gossip?
Apparently, Master <Lion> is in
fact, this mansion's...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm sorry! It's nothing.
Forget I said anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
They won't even let us whisper
in the manor. These rules are
suffocating...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a light falling from
far up in the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Such an amazing light, I've never
seen anything like it before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that the master and butler are
gone, the residence has gone to pot.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I won't even get paid
for all the work I've done...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> has returned, but there's
something different about her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> insisted that I help
take lens to the castle.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue
