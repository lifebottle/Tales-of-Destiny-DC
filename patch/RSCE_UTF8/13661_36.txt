[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like people have noticed the
connection between the world's
state and the President of the
Oberon Corporation
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They've begun protesting
outside of the manor...
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Currently, President <Hugo> is
undergoing treatment for his illness.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Please do not believe any of the rumors
you have heard. They are not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Spare us your corporate spin.
[ENDBLOCK]
If he is REALLY there, we
should be able to see him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is bad. At this rate, there'll
be a full blown hunter's revolt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How do you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The balance between the supply
and demand of Lens is crumbling.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It means that lens hunters' earnings
are worth practically nothing now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's definitely a problem. That's
how they put food on the table.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But what can be done to fix this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the root problem here is that the
Oberon Corporation can't keep up with the
volume of lens people are wanting to sell.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only these people were
just a bit more patient...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then little by little, Oberon would be
able to start buying from them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So all we gotta do is
calm these people down?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that should do it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the- What are you-!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please listen to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I met with President <Hugo>
just yesterday!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He told me himself that, though
he was real sick at first, he'll be
back on his feet in no time!
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, really? Wow!
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't believe it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was also there when he said it.
[ENDBLOCK]
If they are both saying it...
does that mean it's the truth?
[ENDBLOCK]
So then... maybe they really
were just rumors...
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh. I guess we were wrong.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just lied through my teeth... but
it looks like everything worked out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No big deal. You did what you
had to do. I think it'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried about the other city
though. Let's go check on it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been in and out of the mansion
a lot recently. Do you live there?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen Oberon's CEO
or his butler for a while now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the mansion of Oberon's CEO.
Isn't it magnificent?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen Oberon's CEO
or his butler for a while now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The moun... The mountain is gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You're telling me the mastermind
behind this is Oberon's CEO?
You've got to be kidding me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If Oberon is truly responsible,
then the entire company should
be shut down.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that the secret weapon
being built within the castle
uses a lot of lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever I hear the word "lens,"
I can't help but think of
the Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The secret lens weapon has nothing
to do with Oberon, does it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone is relying on you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It has not been publicly disclosed that
Master <Lion> is the CEO's son.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay vigilant and report
any suspicious individuals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Every time I hear about Master
<Lion>'s activities, I want to
brag about him to someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Hugo> is now an important
asset to our country. I am
here to ensure his safety.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been relieved of my duties
to guard <Hugo>'s mansion.
My superiors told me that I'm done.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, out of habit,
I'm still here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It was Mr. <Hugo> who was playing
that broadcast. You can easily
recognize his voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Betraying one's country is a serious
crime. I will never forgive <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I was ordered to watch over
the villa, so I'm still standing here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the mansion,
is waiting for someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think there's anyone who
would come back to this mansion now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the mansion,
is waiting for someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A life free from the influence of lens.
It's not something I can even imagine.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The CEO of Oberon, <Hugo>, has
so many magnificent achievements.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
In a former life, before Mr. <Rembrandt>
found me, I was a lens hunter.

Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A new world for the chosen ones...
I'd like to be taken there, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wasn't chosen to ascend to
the heavens. I suppose that
means I'm not worthy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was a lens hunter,
I was always in danger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The outer shell blocking out the sky
doesn't scare me one bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, greedy witch!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning!

[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I may still be an apprentice,
but I am eager to assist.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh. I'm still an apprentice...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you hear the latest gossip?
Apparently, Master <Lion> is in
fact, this mansion's...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm sorry! It's nothing.
Forget I said anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
They won't even let us whisper
in the manor. These rules are
suffocating...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a light falling from
far up in the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Such an amazing light, I've never
seen anything like it before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that the master and butler are
gone, the residence has gone to pot.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I won't even get paid
for all the work I've done...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> has returned, but there's
something different about her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> insisted that I help
take lens to the castle.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick
from all aquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
