[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
This is bad...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! You're an acquaintance
of <Philia>'s, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Great! Please,
hear me out...
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
A while ago, while cleaning <Philia>'s
room for her, I found an ancient sword.
Not wanting it to get damaged, I stored it away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
But when I told <Philia> that, she
got really scary and demanded I
return it to her at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can certainly
see <Philia> saying that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is that a problem, though?
Just go get it out of storage.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Well...I've forgotten exactly
which room I put it in...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. The temple does
have a lot of storerooms.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, and I'm not able to
leave this spot for the time being.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
So if it's not too much to ask,
could you go find
<Philia>'s sword for her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Old man Clemente might lose
his mind from the lonliness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's try to find him,
Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Guess I've
got no choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. I can't guarantee
I'll find it, but I'll go look.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>'s sword should be in
one of the rooms here in the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>, it's
good to see you again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, great. You came
to get me, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? You're acting like
you didn't want to be found...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, no, I didn't.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
We were certain that you'd get
lonely cooped up in here yourself, sir...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you kidding? This
is the best kind of place!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's perfect for eavesdropping
on secret, forbidden meetings...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah, it's enough to make these
old bones of mine feel young again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Chal. We should get
him back to that priest quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Quickly. Please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
No! Please no! Stop!
Noooooooooooooo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't wanna go!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, looks like you found it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know how
I can repay you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it.
Just never, NEVER do that again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You hear me?
Never again!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-Why are you getting
so angy at me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's nothing to do with you.
Nevertheless, do as I say.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, here's
the sword back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope you've learned your lesson
about spying on other people, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, don't lecture me!
He's the one sneaking out at night!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's the one...?
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Exactly what I said.
The priest in front of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yes? Did you need
something else...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you want to know
where I found it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yes, that's right!
Tell me, where was it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you know, where you...
you know...at night...
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
...At night?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No, nevermind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just be careful
from now on!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-Whew...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
All the barrier stones should
have been destroyed. You will be
able to open the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've broke all the barrier stones. We should be able to open the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then we'll open it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
All the barrier stones have been
destroyed. You should now be able
to open the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, let's get
through this door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
All the barrier stones have been
destroyed. You should now be able
to open the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, let's get through this door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
All the barrier stones should
have been destroyed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's get this door open.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
All the barrier stones should have
been destroyed. You will be able
to open the door
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's Sealed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some barrier stones are still in place.
Let's search inside the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's Sealed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some barrier stones are still in place.
Let's search inside the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's Sealed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some barrier stones are still in place.
Let's search inside the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's Sealed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]

Let's search inside the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The barrier stone still remains.
Look carefully inside the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe <Greybum> is
revolting. Oh, how horrorific...
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>'s sword should be in
one of the rooms in the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for finding the sword.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe <Greybum> is
revolting. Oh, how horrorific...
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> has been punished
by the goddess. He deserved it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Goddess... why do you
give us so many trials?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
May Atamony bless
all people on earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
During <Greybum>'s rebellion,
I could do nothing but cower.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
We must always be prepared so that
we never have to go through something
like that again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that there was a tremendous
lightning strike near Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think it's possible for
a simple human being to cover
the whole sky with a shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that you are going to fly
up to the heavens on a dragon?
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
Human potential is infinite,  what
matters the most is how we use it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, we've talked before, it was
in village of Armeida I think.
[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
The bishop is in the cathedral.
[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
こんなに広くちゃ分からないわ。

[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems like it's kind of a big deal, but
the higher-ups will take care of it, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there's nothing the higher-ups
can do about it. I guess I'll just have to ask
Goddess for help.
[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoever you are, do something! Please!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
You're <Philia>, aren't you?
I've heard a lot of things about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I have just recently entered the path of faith. 
Please give me your best advice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
You are the one who saved this temple,
aren't you? I've heard so much about you.

[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that it's in adversity that
the power of our faith is tested.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
All I can do is pray.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's completely deserted
in here, too...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hello! Is anyone here??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't just shout like that!
What if the enemy heard you??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There might be someone in
trouble here. They need to
know that we've come to help!
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Is someone out there?
Please, we're trapped in here..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Look! That door over
there is glowing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you locked
behind this door?
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yes! I am!
Please help me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry! We'll get
you out of there!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, <Stahn>. A barrier has
been placed upon this door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's from Barrier Stones..!
Those are ancient technology!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
How do we remove
this barrier?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
There should be Barrier Stones
around here. Destroy them all,
and the barrier will dissolve.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha. Let's do this, <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He wasn't talking to you.
Don't cut into our conversation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, but do you mind
waiting just a bit longer?
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sure, that is alright.

Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll

you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

up one you like, so you can set it on
