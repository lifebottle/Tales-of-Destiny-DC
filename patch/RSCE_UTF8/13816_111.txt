[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
This is bad...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! You're an acquaintance
of <Philia>'s, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Great! Please,
hear me out...
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
A while ago, while cleaning <Philia>'s
room for her, I found an old sword.
I stored it away, not wanting it to
get damaged,
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
but when I told <Philia> that, she
got really scary and demanded
I return it to her at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can certainly see
<Philia> saying that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is that a problem, though?
Just go get it out of storage.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... I've forgotten exactly
which room I put it in...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. The temple does have
a lot of storerooms.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, and I'm not able
to leave this spot for
the time being.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
So if it's not too much to
ask, could you go find
<Philia>'s sword for me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Old man <Clemente> might lose
his mind from the loneliness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Let's try to find him,
Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Guess I've got
no choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. I can't guarantee
I'll find it, but I'll go look.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>'s sword should be
in one of the rooms in
the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Clemente>, it's good
to see you again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Oh, great. You came
to get me, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? You're acting like you
didn't want to be found...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, no, I didn't.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We were certain that you'd get lonely
cooped up in here by yourself, sir...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you kidding? This is
the best kind of place!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's perfect for eavesdropping
on secret, forbidden meetings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Aah, it's enough to make these old
bones of mine feel young again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Chal. We should
get him back to that
priest, quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Quickly. Please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>No! Please, no! Stop!
Noooooooooooooo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't wanna go!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, looks like
you found it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know how
I can repay you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it.
Just never, NEVER
do that again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You hear me?
Never again!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-Why are you getting
so angry at me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's nothing to do with
you. Just do what I say.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, here's
the sword back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope you've learned your lesson
about spying on other people, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Hey, don't lecture me! He's the 
one sneaking out at night!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>He's the one...?
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Exactly what I said. The
priest in front of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yes? Did you need
something else...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you want to know
where I found it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yes, that's right!
Tell me, where was it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you know, where you...
you know... at night...
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
...At night?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No, never mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just be careful
from now on!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-Whew...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>All the barrier stones should
have been destroyed. You will
be able to open the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've broken all the barrier stones.
We should be able to open the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then we'll open it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>All the barrier stones should
have been destroyed. You will
be able to open the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, let's get
through this door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>All the barrier stones should
have been destroyed. You will
be able to open the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, let's get through this door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
All the barrier stones
should be done for.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's get this door open.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>All the barrier stones should
have been destroyed. You will
be able to open the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's sealed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some barrier stones still remain in place.
Look carefully inside the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's sealed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some barrier stones still remain in place.
Look carefully inside the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's sealed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some barrier stones still remain in place.
Look carefully inside the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe <Greybum> is
revolting. How awful...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>'s sword should be
in one of the rooms in
the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for finding
the sword.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe <Greybum> is
revolting. How awful...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> has been punished by
the Goddess. He deserved it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh Atamoni... why must
you test us so?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
May Atamoni bless all the
people of this Earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
During <Greybum>'s rebellion, I
could do nothing but cower.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
We must always be prepared so
that we never have to go through
something like that again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that there was a tremendous
lightning strike near Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought a mere
human could cover the
sky with darkness like
this...
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that you are going to fly
up to the heavens on a dragon?
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
Human potential is limitless.
What matters the most is
how we use it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, we've talked before, it was
in village of Armeida I think.
[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
The bishop is in 
the cathedral.
[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
This place is way too big
though! I can't find it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems like it's kind of a big deal,
but the higher-ups will take care of
it, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess the higher-ups can't
do anything. Looks like all
I can do is pray to Atamoni...
[ENDBLOCK]
Pilgrim
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoever you are, do
something! Please!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
You're <Philia>, aren't you?
I've heard a lot about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I've only recently joined the temple.
I'd appreciate any advice!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
You are the one who saved
this temple, aren't you? I've
heard so much about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that it's in adversity that
the power of our faith is tested.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
All I can do is pray.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's completely deserted
in here, too...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hello! Is anyone here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Don't just shout like that!
What if an enemy heard you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There might be someone in trouble
here. They need to know that we've
come to help!
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Is someone out there? Please,
we're trapped in here...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Look! That door over
there is glowing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you locked
behind this door?
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yes! We are!
Please help us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry! We'll get
you out of there!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Hold on, <Stahn>. A barrier has
been placed upon this door.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Barrier Stones...!
Those are ancient technology!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
How do we remove
this barrier?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>There should be Barrier Stones
around here. Destroy them all,
and the barrier will dissolve.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha. Let's do this, <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He wasn't talking to you. Don't
cut into our conversation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, but do you mind
waiting just a bit longer?
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sure, that is all right.
