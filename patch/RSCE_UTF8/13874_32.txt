[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wooow, the sea is huge!
It's so calming!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is exciting! It's my
first time on a ship.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Remember, we are not on vacation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... um... what is it...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, what do you know
about the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Honestly? Not much. I've read a
little about it in the past, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then can you tell me anything
about it? I'd never ever heard
of it until recently, so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yes, of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you know about the
Aeth'er Wars? The war between
Earth and Heaven?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The story is usually told as a myth,
but it's based on real history.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A war between... Earth and...
Heaven? Is that right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's exactly as it sounds.
It was a war that split 
the world in two.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The books I read say that the
Eye of Atamoni was the cause
of the Aeth'er Wars.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
"The source of the great calamity
that befell the world."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe it. I saw it for
myself. It had an ominous,
overwhelming presence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We cannot allow its power to
be unleashed on the world.
We have to get it back!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah, you're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, you're really smart, right?
From here on out, please teach
me everything you know, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've brought Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, you don't look so good.
Are you doing okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we're going to be chasing
<Greybum>, I have a proposal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>As long as they possess the
Eye of Atamoni, we'll need 
to strengthen ourselves.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, there should be a
place in the sea nearby where
a Swordian is sleeping.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>If I'm correct, it's inside a ship
that sunk into the sea near the 
Second Continent a long time ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Swordian's name is <Clemente>.
He would no doubt be useful to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should go get him, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fine, isn't it? Let's go.
This is a great opportunity.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And this time, I can
pawn it off for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you know exactly where
this transport ship sunk?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's go then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>! Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A fourth Swordian, huh? Sounds fun!
I wonder what this one is like?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>. Um... thank
you very much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to your consideration
for me, I've calmed down quite
a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's still plenty I've yet to learn,
but if there is anything you'd like to
know about from now on, just ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll answer to the
best of my ability.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice! I'll be counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good work, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did I do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You don't even realize it, do you? 
Well, that's fine. That's just the
kind of person you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> got away
from us once again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not anyone's fault.
We'll get him next time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
About <Greybum>, what was
he like back at the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was incredibly intelligent,
and extremely pious. Someone
you could look up to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Many priests adored him. He had
many devout followers, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That reminds me. We didn't
see <Batista> in Calviola at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Another priest, and <Greybum>'s
most trusted aide. I considered
him to be my mentor, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, you'd dare disobey
High Priest <Greybum>?
Foolish girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since you're so hard-headed,
I reckon it's only fitting to
have a stone body to match!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sorry... I was just
lost in thought.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'll be on the deck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>'s face didn't look so
good. Think he'll be okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, isn't he always like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know we're going to Aquaveil,
but what kinda place is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, Aquaveil isn't
just one single state.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the general name for a
group of allied provinces:
Shiden, Moreau, and Terazzi.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The countries are made up
of many islands, and they
travel by boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> said that they
were hostile?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, they've imposed a policy of
national isolation. It's almost
impossible for anyone to make
contact with them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Their relations with Seinegald
are particularly bad. She was
probably referring to that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard through the grapevine that
Aquaveil has a really strong navy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What if they're connected
to that Armada?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to think for a bit.
I'll be on the deck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, the Eye of Atamoni, huh?
Didn't think that'd be possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll definitely need
my help for this one!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, <Philia>. Why'd
you come get me first?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? I... That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry! I didn't
disturb you, did I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you, <Stahn>! Don't
you be mean to <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not being mean!
I was just...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wondering why you didn't
join up with <Lion> first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean, he'd be
closer, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> is... We have no
idea where he went.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Philia> had asked the <King> 
and the General, but they couldn't
give us a clear answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried... I sure hope nothing
weird's going on with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Chaltier> is with him.
I'm sure they'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's hurry up and join the others,
then return to Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is <Stahn> doing...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not good. He won't listen to a word I
say. He's just standing there on the
deck with that scary look on his face.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's too good-natured.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I told him before, he's
too trusting of others...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... I hope he's okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> has a lot of compassion for
people. That's why he's suffering.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's up to all of us
to support him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
