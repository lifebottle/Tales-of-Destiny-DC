<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wooow, the sea is huge!!
It's so nice...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is so exciting! It's
my first time on a ship
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Remember we are not here
on vacation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... um... what is it...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, what do you know
about the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Honestly? Not much. I've read a
little about it before, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then can you tell me anything about
it? I'd never ever heard about it, so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-yes, of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Stahn>. Do you know about
the Aeth'er Wars?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's generally spread as a myth,
but it actually happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A war between... Earth and... Air?
How does that work?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Exactly. A war that split
the world in two.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's written in books that the
Eye of Atamoni was the cause
of the Aeth'er Wars.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
"The cause of the great calamity
that befell the world"...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe it's true. I saw it
for myself. It had this ominous...
overwhelming presence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't let that thing out into the
world. No matter what, we have to
get it back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah. You're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, You know a lot right?
From here on out, Please teach me
everything you know okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've brought Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, you don't look so good.
Are you alright?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we're going to be chasing after
<Greybum>, I have a proposal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as they possess the Eye of
Atamoni, we'll need to strengthen
ourselves.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, there should be a place in
the ocean nearby where a swordian
is sleeping.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I'm correct, it's inside a
ship that sunk into the sea
near the Second Continent a long
time ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Swordian's name is Clemente.
He would no doubt be useful to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should go 
get him, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fine, isn't it? Let's go.
This is a great opportunity.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And this time, I can pawn it
off for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And do you know exactly where this
transport ship sunk?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. let's go then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>! Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A fourth Swordian, huh? Sounds fun!
I wonder what this one will be like?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> Um... thank you
very much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to your considerading me,
I've calmed down quite a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a lot I don't know, but
please ask me if there is anything 
you'd like to know about from now on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll answer you to the
best of my ability.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice! I'll be counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good work, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did I do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't even realize it? Well,
that's fine. That's just the kind
of person you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> got away
from us once again...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not anyone's fault.
We'll definitely get him next time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes, you're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
About <Greybum>, what was he
like back at the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was incredibly intelligent,
and extremely pious. Someone
you could look up to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Many priests adored him. He had
a lot of devout followers, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That reminds me. We didn't
see <Batista> in Calviola at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>..?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Another priest, and <Greybum>'s
most trusted aide. I considered
him to be my mentor, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, you'd dare disobey 
High Priest <Greybum>?
Foolish girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since you're so hard-headed,
I reckon it's only fitting
to have a stone body to match!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sorry...I was just
lost in thought...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'll be on the deck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>'s face didn't look so good.
Think he'll be OK?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, isn't he always like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to Aquaveil,
but what kinda place is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, Aquaveil is not just
one single state.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the generic name for a
group of allied provinces:
Shiden, Moreau, and Terazzi. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The countries are made up
of many islands, and 
they come and go by boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> said that
they were hostile?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
They've imposed a policy of national
isolation, so it's almost impossible
for other countries to make contact.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Its relations with Seinegald are
particularly bad. She was probably
referring to that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard through the grapevine that
Aquaveil has a really strong navy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What if they're connected
to that Armeida?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to think for a bit.
I'll be on the deck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, Atamoni's Eye...
I didn't know it was possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is going to require
more of my help!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...By the way. Why did <Philia>,
first come to me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? It's that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so sorry.
Did I bother you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you, <Stahn>!
Don't be mean <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not mean. I'm Just...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wondering why you didn't
join up with <Lion> first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because you were supposed to
be the closest one, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> is at... We have no 
idea where he went.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia> had asked the <King>
and the General. There was 
no clear answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried about him...
I hope it's not too weird.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier> is with him.
I'm sure they'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's hurry up and join the others,
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is Mr. <Stahn> doing...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's just standing there on the
deck with a scary look on his face.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's too good-natured.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I told you to learn to
be a little more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> I hope you are okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> has great compassion 
for people. That is why he is
suffering now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's up to all of us 
to support him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
