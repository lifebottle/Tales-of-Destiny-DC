<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
There he is!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't expect you to
chase  me this far.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That voice...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We already know who
you are. Why don't you take 
off that hideous disguise?
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
...You're one brave young lady.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were the mastermind behind all
of this, weren't you? What are you going
to do with the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you gonna be like <Greybum>
and act like some kinda king of monsters?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Being able to control monsters
is just a side benefit of the true
power of the Eye of Atamoni...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahahaha... What if I told you
this was all my plan, all along?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tempting <Greybum> and convincing
him to steal the Eye of Atamoni...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then taking it all over
the world like he did...
What if that was all part of my plan?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was going to dispose of <Greybum> 
when I was done with him anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
In killing him for me, you saved me
some effort. I'm quite grateful!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We didn't do it for you!
Don't be getting carried away!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
That angry face of yours...
Just like your dear mother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well! I'm a busy man, with little time.
I'm sorry to leave you, but 
I must be on my way, now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion>!
Stop <Hugo>, please!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I knew it! You had 
to have a plan, didn't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right? That's right,
isn't it, <Lion>?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...!
I knew it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Go on ahead.
I'll hold them here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, you...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>!	What's going one?!
Answer me,	<Chaltier>!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, you're kidding, right?
It's...just a joke, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yes, I understand exactly what
I'm doing, far more than you do!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah...Hah...
I...won...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it! Why won't
you just stay down?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>!	Hey!
Stay with me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph...one on one, I 
wouldn't have lost...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You idiot! Why are 
you doing this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't blame
Master <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
He had no choice but to do 
this to protect <Marian>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>...now you
say something...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal! You're
saying too much!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You all saw her at <Hugo>'s 
manor, remember?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The maid who brought
me <Dymlos>! <Lion>, you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
So she's been
taken hostage...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
But that doesn't mean you're
doing the right thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're still a
Swordian Master!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Say whatever you want!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I don't have a shred 
of regret for what I've done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if I were reborn a hundred times
over, I would still choose the same path!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not letting
you through!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
This person you've become...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why go that far...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You stupid idiot!
Why are you so stubborn?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're making a mistake!
Do you hear me, <Lion>!? You're wrong!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut up!! I've already made
up my mind...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why I'm saying you're 
wrong about being alone!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why can't you understand that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, be careful!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay back...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why didn't you talk to me 
about it! Why did you try to
do it all by yourself!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're friends! Friends!
Why didn't you tell me? Why!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I said stay back!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're on your own!
Suffering alone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you the only one having
a hard time!? Why are you the only 
one getting hurt??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Friends are supposed to help 
each other through hard times!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How could you
not know that?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even after everything...
You still consider me your friend...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hey <Lion>, it's not 
too late. Come with us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're going to take it all back. 
We'll take back the Eye of Atamoni,
and Marian!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seriously...
You're a real piece of work...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! You understand me, right??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...I...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, let's shake hands 
to make up. Come on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
An earthquake?	In the 
middle of nowhere??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That damn <Hugo>...!
He's already begun!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Begun...?	Are you saying that 
<Hugo> is causing this earthquake?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though
you're still here??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the type of
person <Hugo> is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, go see if 
the elevator is safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no, no!	The ceiling collapsed!
We can't get back to the elevator!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What're we gonna do!?
We're gonna be buried alive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that sound?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems the cave is collapsing, and 
the seawater is flowing in...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
No...! This place will be
completely submerged!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...There's a way out.
Look over there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's an emergency lift.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something
Like that here??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, hurry up and get in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You too, <Lion>. Come on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't come with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
To move the lift, someone needs
to operate the lever here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, what are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, I'll tell you what 
you deserve to know, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s deceased wife. 
her name was Chris Katrea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris was...also my mother...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
As much as I hate to admit it, 
the same blood flows through our veins.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're...lying...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, just get over here!
We'll talk later!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You call me your friend, but I don't
remember agreeing to that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...can't stand laid-back, careless,
overly-friendly people like you...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And that's why...
I leave the rest to you...
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
