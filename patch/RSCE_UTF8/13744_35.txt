[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
These people realized that the general
of Oberon Corporation is connected to
the world's anomalies.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why they're pouring in like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
The General is currently recuperating
from his injuries.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
The rumors circulating in 
the world are not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course they're not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then bring <Hugo> here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not good. If we don't
do something, the hunters will
start a riot.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you understand?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The balance between supply
and demand for lenses, it's
out of balance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What does that mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It means the lens hunters 
will lose all their money.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's definitely a problem.
When you can't make a living.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But what do we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The problem is that Oberon can't
keep up with all the people trying
to sell lens in bulk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only the people selling 
the lens were more patient.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That way, Oberon can buy
a few more lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So if we calm these people
down, we're good?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? What are you going to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please listen to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me, I met <Hugo> yesterday.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was a little sick, but he 
said he'll be fine soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
It must be true!
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was there with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
If two people say it, it must 
be true, yeah?
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, then it was 
really just a rumor.
[ENDBLOCK]
Something tells me we were
wrong about that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Somehow it worked, but...
I still don't like lying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be helped. It's okay to 
tell a little white lie.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried about the rest of the city.
Let's go check it out.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been in and out of the
mansion, do you live here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen the President
of Oberon or the Steward of
the mansion in a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Oberon's headquarters.
Magnificent, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen the President
of Oberon or the Steward of
the mansion in a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahhhh! the mon...
the mountain is gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard the mastermind behind 
this is the President of Oberon?
You've got to be kidding me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If this was going to happen,
we should have shut down
Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The secret weapon they're building
at the castle uses a lot of lens,
right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
When I hear the word "lens",
I think of Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The secret lens weapon has nothing
to do with Oberon, does it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It has not been disclosed
that Master <Lion> is the 
son of this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Please be wary of
suspicious individuals.

[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Every time I hear about Master
<Lion>'s activities, I want to
brag about him to someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Hugo> is now an important
person in our country.
I'm here to protect him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been relieved of my duties
to guard the <Hugo> mansion.
My superiors told me
that I'm done.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, out of habit,
I'm still here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It was Mr. <Hugo> who was
playing that broadcast.
You can easily recognize
his voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
The crime of betraying our
country is serious.
I will never forgive <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I was ordered to watch over
the villa, so I'm still 
standing here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the mansion,
is waiting for someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think there's anyone who
would come back to this mansion now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the mansion,
is waiting for someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Nowadays, I can't imagine my
life without lens products.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
President <Hugo>'s achievements
are just too great.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I used to be a lens hunter too,
but Mr. <Rembrandt> picked me up
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, the heavens didn't pick me. 
Guess I am not worthy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was a lens hunter,
I was always in danger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not scared by the fact that the sky
 is now covered with an outer shell.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, you greedy witch!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning!

[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm still an apprentice, but I'm
looking forward to work with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh. I'm still an apprentice...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know? Master <Lion> is
in fact, this mansion's...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry!
It's nothing, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Chit chating is not allowed
in the house.
I feel suffocated every day.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a light falling from
far up in the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Such an amazing light, I've never
seen anything like it before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that the master and butler
are gone, this house is ruined.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I won't even get Paid
for all the work I've done...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> has returned.
She's changed her mood.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> told me to take the lens
to the castle too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, what a coincidence.
I thought you were asleep.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought if I came here, I'd see you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh. That's a pretty good line for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you just barely passed,
didn't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's about your future plans.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do when
this fight is over?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm thinking of going on another trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've still got a lot to learn, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're all tied together by some
weird fate, aren't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you might be right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, you were almost executed
once when you were caught hiding on
the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You bring up an old story.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That time, a monster lunged
to attack me unexpectedly, 
and you saved me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, my God, I did do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you did.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were so dumb, I just 
had to help you out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So <Rutee>, you saved my life too...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I think about it, a lot of
things have happened since then,
haven't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's really... a lot of things. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it ends tomorrow. This is the last
time I'll ever have to deal with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'll be such a relief.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you know what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When this battle is over, why don't
you and I take a little trip?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you... are you hitting on me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this...
Is that what it's supposed to be like?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just wanted you to be there
for me, that's all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope we can stand in the same place, 
walk in the same direction, and look at
the same sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why in this world, that
kind of thing is called hitting
on someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I didn't know...
I didn't know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't freak out after you say it.
You're so boring.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's... but I guess that's
just who you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what's your answer?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...do you want to hear it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
My answer is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Don't tell anyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell is that! That's not fair!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not obligated to answer.
What do you want me to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's true, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, we'll put a pin in that.
I'll tell you when we get back safely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to pout?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not pouting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Damn it, you can't help it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay? It's not enough to win
tomorrow. That's just the way
it has to be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're gonna win, and we're
gonna come back alive. All of
us together. Understood?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You want to hear my answer, don't you?
Then whatever it takes,  we survive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you're the one.
Now that you've said it, I promise you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's obvious. I'm the one, remember?
I'm not going to die even if you kill me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I promise you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I promise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I guess that's it for now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that we have something to
look forward to later, let's get 
back to the others, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where is everyone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're probably gathering at the bar.
It's hard to sleep at a time like this.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
