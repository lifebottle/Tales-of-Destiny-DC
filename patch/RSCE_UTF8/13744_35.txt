[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
People have realized the CEO
of Oberon is complicit in the
strange events happening all
around the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They've begun protesting
outside of the manor...
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
President <Hugo> is currently
recuperating from a serious
illness.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't believe the rumors
going around. They are not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, that's not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then bring <Hugo> out here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is bad. If this continues
the hunters are going to riot.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you be sure?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Supply and demand for
lens is all out of whack.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What does that mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It means the lens hunters
will lose all their money.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So they will lose their livelihood.
That's definitely a problem.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But what can be done to fix this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The problem is that Oberon can't
keep up with all the people trying
to sell-off their lens in bulk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only these people were
just a bit more patient...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That way, little by little Oberon
could slowly buy up more lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So all we gotta do is calm
these people down?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? What are
you going to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please listen to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I met with President
<Hugo> just yesterday!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He told me himself, though
he's real sick, he'll be back
on his feet in no time!
[ENDBLOCK]
It must be true!
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was there with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
If they are both saying so,
it must be true, yeah?
[ENDBLOCK]
So then... maybe it really
was just a rumor...
[ENDBLOCK]
So it was all a misunderstanding.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe that worked,
but... I'm not a fan of lying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's no big deal. You did what you
had to do. I'm sure it's fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried about the rest of
the city. Let's go check it out.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been in and out of
the mansion a lot recently.
Do you live there?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen Oberon's CEO
or his butler for a while now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the mansion of Oberon's
CEO. Isn't it magnificent?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen Oberon's CEO
or his butler for a while now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The moun... The mountain is gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean to tell me Oberon's CEO
is the mastermind behind this?
You've got to be kidding me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If Oberon is truly responsible,
then the entire company should
be shut down.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that the secret weapon
being built at the castle uses a
lot of lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever I hear the word "lens,"
I can't help but think of the
Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The secret lens weapon has nothing
to do with Oberon, does it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone is relying on you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It has not been made public that
Master <Lion> is the CEO's son.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay vigilant and report
any suspicious individuals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Every time I hear about Master <Lion>'s
activities, I want to brag about him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Hugo> is now an important asset
to our country. I am here to ensure
his safety.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been relieved of my duties to
guard <Hugo>'s mansion. This is a
direct order from my superiors.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, out of habit,
I'm still here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It was Mr. <Hugo> who was
broadcasting. As soon as
I heard his voice, I knew.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Betraying one's country is a serious
crime. I'll never forgive <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I was ordered to watch over the
estate. As such, I will not leave
this post.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the
mansion, is waiting for
someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think there's anyone
who would come back to this
mansion now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the
mansion, is waiting for
someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A life free from the influence of
lens. I can't even imagine it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The CEO of Oberon, <Hugo>,
has so many magnificent 
achievements.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
In a former life, before Mr. <Rembrandt>
found me, I was a lens hunter.

[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I may still be an apprentice,
but I am eager to assist.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh. I'm still an apprentice...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you hear the latest gossip?
Apparently, Master <Lion> is in
fact, this mansion's...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm sorry! It's nothing.
Forget I said anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
They won't even let us whisper
in the manor. These rules are
suffocating...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a light falling from
far up in the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Such an amazing light, I've never
seen anything like it before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that the master and butler are
gone, the residence has gone to pot.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I won't even get paid
for all the work I've done...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> has returned, but there's
something different about her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> insisted that I help
take lens to the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, what a coincidence. I
thought you were asleep.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought if I came here, I'd see you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh. You know, that's not a bad line.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you just barely passed...
...I guess?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Passed what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm talking about showing
your worth as a man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, what are you going
to do when this fight is over?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm thinking of going
on another journey.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've still got a lot to
learn, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...We're all tied together by some
weird destiny, aren't we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you might be right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, back when they found you
hiding in the Draconis... weren't you
almost executed?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That feels like it happened ages ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Back then, something flew by
unexpectedly and hit one of
the soldiers, saving me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I did that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-You did?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were so dumb, I just
had to help you out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you were my guardian angel...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's when it all started,
but we've been through a
whole lot since then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's true...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's really... quite a lot...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it ends tomorrow. This is the last
time I'll ever have to deal with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'll be such a relief.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you know what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When this battle is over, why don't
you and I go on a journey together?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you... Are you hitting on me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wha...? What's that
supposed to mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just wanted to continue
being by your side.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
To visit the same places, experience
new things, and look up at the same
sky. together...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the normal world, when people say
that kind of thing it is called hitting
on someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-Is that so...?
I had no idea...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't get all flustered now that
you've said it. It's pretty sloppy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... I guess that's
just who you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what's your answer?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Do you want to hear it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
My answer is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...It's a secret.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the heck is that!?
That's not fair!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not obligated to answer. Do
you think complaining will help?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's true, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, we'll put a pin in
that. I'll tell you when
we get back safely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to pout?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not pouting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Damn it, guess I don't
have a choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay? It's not enough just to
win tomorrow. That's the way
it has to be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're gonna win, and we're
gonna come back alive. All of
us, together. Understood?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You want to hear my answer, don't you?
Then whatever it takes, you survive!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You too, <Rutee>. After saying
all that, you'd better keep to
that promise as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. It's me, remember?
I won't die even if they kill me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You promise?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I promise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I guess that's it for now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that we have something to
look forward to later, let's get
back to the others, shall we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where is everyone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're probably gathered at the bar.
It's hard to sleep at a time like this.
