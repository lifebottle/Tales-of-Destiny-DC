<TAG_005>There's nothing in it.

Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys are..!
... No, it's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please protect
the prince!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to Terazzi?
Please take care of yourself.

[ENDBLOCK]
As a proud official of the
Shiden Territory, I'm improving
our relations with Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's times like these that we need to
mobilize Aquaveil full power.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Prince! Is there anything I
can do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm ready to do anything for
the sake of our Prince.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Prince. When you win, we'll spread
your song to the world!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
What <Tiberius> said about that
sword is true, it originally
came from Aquaveil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since the Royal Family of
Shiden found it, my ancestors
kept it enshrined as a sacred
treasure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then why does
<Lion> have it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
About ten years ago,
it was stolen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't do it! Don't look
at me like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even I don't know who did it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cha-... This sword belongs to
me now, I'm not handing it over.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care, that was a long
time ago. Besides, I'm not very
good with a sword.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You came all this way. But
it seems I won't be needing
your aid after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't the slightest desire
to quarrel with <Tiberius>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came to Moreau on a mere
whim. All I want is to spend my
days as selfishly as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's fine by us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But are you really okay
with that, <Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius> is definitely going to
invade Shiden next, you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is what my fellow countrymen
are worried about. Even though I worry
about it too, there's nothing i can do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the impression we
got when we listened to
the townspeople.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know anything
about <Tiberius>'s new
advisor, <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. Right now,
he is in Terazzi,
<Tiberius>'s home land.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
In other words, we
just missed him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it possible to
get to Terazzi?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not at all. Their waters
have stricter security
than even Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now if you had <Fayte>'s Black
Cross armada, there's a chance
you could break through...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Prince, there's an emergency!
They're executing <Fayte>!
[ENDBLOCK]
That damn new governor
<Batista> has just declared it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hoho. Now there's a story
that reeks of blood.
[ENDBLOCK]
Prince, now is the time to make
a stand! You can't just stand
idly and watch <Fayte> die! 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
He has always been prepared
for this. There's nothing I 
can do for him now.
[ENDBLOCK]
But sir, isn't <Fayte> 
your friend?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, I am a but a clown. I understand
how you feel, but that's expecting
too much of me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Prince!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's supposed to be royalty?
Unbelievable...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, brief us of the situation.
We're the aids from Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, the son of the former lord
of Moreau, has been confined
inside the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
His wife <Rihanna> is with him...
*Gasp*... At this rate, they'll...
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you! Did you tell the
Prince about <Fayte>?!
[ENDBLOCK]
He's heading toward
Moreau Castle by himself!
[ENDBLOCK]
Alone?! What does he
mean to do?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems like this was
his plan all along.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though he implied
he wasn't going to help huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We gotta go
after <Johnny>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Agreed. As long as <Batista> is
involved. We can't just leave
it like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, everyone! I beg of you
please help our Prince!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. <Johnny> aside. <Fayte>
could prove useful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of the Black
Cross armada, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's our only option if we
want to get to Terazzi.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then it's decided!
[ENDBLOCK]
The front entrance of the
castle has been closed. I'll take
you through the back by boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
The boat will be on standby outside.
Please call out for us when you've
finished your preparations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Got it!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
