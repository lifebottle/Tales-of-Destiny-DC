<TAG_005>There's nothing inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You're...! ...No,
never mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Please keep Lord <Johnny> safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to Terazzi?
Please take care of yourself.

Are you going to Terazzi?

Man
[ENDBLOCK]
As a proud official of Shiden,
I'm working to improve our
relations with Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
At times like this, Aquaveil
must unite as one!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>! Is
there anything I
can do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm prepared to do anything
for Lord <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>! We'll spread your
song of victory to the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>! We'll spread your
song of victory to the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
What <Tiberius> said about your
sword is true. It did originally
reside here in Aquaveil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since the royal family of
Shiden found it, my ancestors
kept it enshrined as a sacred
treasure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then why does
<Lion> have it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was stolen from
its shrine around
ten years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't me! Don't look
at me like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even I don't know who stole me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cha-... This sword belongs to me
now, I'm not handing it over.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care. It happened a long
time ago, after all. Besides, I'm
hopeless with a blade.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I appreciate you coming all this
way, but I won't be needing you,
after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't even the slightest desire
to quarrel with <Tiberius>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came to Moreau on nothing more than
a whim. All I wish is to spend my days
as carefree as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's fine by us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But are you really okay
with that, <Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius>'ll surely invade
Shiden next, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's for my fellow countrymen
to handle. Even if I cared, there's 
nothing I could do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's just like how
the townspeople
described him...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know anything
about <Tiberius>' new
advisor, <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure do. Right now, he
is in Terazzi, <Tiberius>'
home land.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
In other words, we
just missed him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there any way
to reach Terazzi?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nope. Their waters have even
tighter security than Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now if you had <Fayte>'s Black
Cross armada on your side...
Perhaps then you could break
through.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>, I have urgent news!
They're going to execute Lord <Fayte>!
[ENDBLOCK]
That damned new governor <Batista>
announced it just now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hoho. Now there's a story
that reeks of blood.
[ENDBLOCK]
My lord, now is the time to make
a move! You can't just stand by
and let Lord <Fayte> die!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's always been prepared
for this. There's nothing I
can do for him now.
[ENDBLOCK]
But my lord, isn't Lord
<Fayte> your friend?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, come now, I'm nothing more than
a clown. I understand how you feel,
but that's just too much pressure 
for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Prince!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>He's supposed to be royalty?
Unbelievable...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, we're the backup from Shiden.
Brief us on the situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Fayte>, the son of the former
lord of Moreau, has been confined
inside the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
His wife <Rihanna> is with him...
Aah... At this rate, they'll...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you! Did you tell Lord
<Johnny> about Lord <Fayte>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
He's heading toward Moreau
Castle by himself!
[ENDBLOCK]
Alone!? What does
he intend to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It seems that this was
his plan all along.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though he said he wasn't
going to help, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've gotta go
after <Johnny>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Agreed. As long as <Batista> is
involved, we can't just leave
it like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, everyone! I beg of you,
please help Lord <Johnny>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. <Johnny> aside, this <Fayte>
person could prove useful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of the Black
Cross Armada, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's our only option if we
want to get to Terazzi.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then it's settled!
[ENDBLOCK]
The front entrance of the castle has
been closed. I'll take you through the
back by boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll have it on standby outside.
Please come find us when you've
finished your preparations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Got it!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
