<TAG_005>There's nothing in it.

Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys are..!
... No, it's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please protect
the prince!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to Terazzi?
Please take care of yourself.

[ENDBLOCK]
As a proud official of the
Shiden Territory, I'm improving
our relations with Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's times like these that we need to
mobilize Aquaveil full power.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Prince! Is there anything I
can do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm ready to do anything for
the sake of our Prince.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Prince. When you win, we'll spread
your song to the world!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
What <Tiberius> said about
that sword is true, it originally
came from Aquaveil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since the Royal Family of
Shiden, my ancestors, found it,
it has been enshrined as a
sacred treasure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then why does <Lion> have it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
About ten years ago,
it was stolen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't do it! Don't look
at me like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even I don't know who did it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal, this sword belongs to me
now. Do not ask me to return it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care, that was a long
time ago. Besides, I'm
not very good with a sword.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry you had to come all
this way. It seems i won't be
needing your aid after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't the slightest desire
to quarrel with <Tiberius>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came to Moreau on a mere
whim. All I want is to spend my
days as selfishly as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't really care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But are you really okay
with that, <Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Tiberius> is definitely going to
invade Shiden next, you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is what my fellow countrymen
are worried about. Even I can't
help but think about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the impression we
got when we listened
to the townspeople.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know anything
about <Tiberius>'s new
advisor, <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. Right now, he is in
Terazzi, <Tiberius>'s home land.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
In other words, we missed him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it possible to get to Terazzi?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not at all. Their waters
have stricter security
than even Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now if you had <Fayte>'s Black
Cross armada, there's a chance
you could break through the line
of defense, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Prince, there's an emergency!
They're executing <Fayte>!
[ENDBLOCK]
That new governor
<Batista> must
have declared it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Batista>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hoho. Now there's a story
that reeks of blood.
[ENDBLOCK]
Prince, now is the time to make
a stand! You can't just stand
idly and watch <Fayte> die! 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
He has always been prepared
for this. There's nothing I 
can do for him now.
[ENDBLOCK]
But sir, isn't <Fayte> 
your friend?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am a but a clown. Expecting too
much from me is quite selfish. And
trying to force me into this is
quite troublesome too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Prince!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
And this guy is supposed to be
royalty? Seriously, how pathetic.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Brief us of the situation.
We're the aids from Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, the son of the
former lord of Moreau, has
been confined inside the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
His wife <Rihanna> is with him...
Ahh... At this rate, they'll...
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you! Did you tell the
Prince about <Fayte>?!
[ENDBLOCK]
He's heading toward
Moreau Castle all alone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Alone?! What is the
meaning of this?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems like this was
his plan all along.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though he told us he had
no intention of helping.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We gotta go after <Johnny>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. As long as <Batista> is
involved. We can't just leave
it like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, everyone! Please find
a way to save the Prince!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'll be fine. <Johnny>
aside, <Fayte> seems like
he's worth going after.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of the Black
Cross armada, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's our only option if we
want to get to Terazzi.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then it's decided!
[ENDBLOCK]
The front entrance of the
castle has been closed. I'll take
you through the back by boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
The boat is on standby outside.
Please call out for us when you've
finished your preparations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Got it!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
