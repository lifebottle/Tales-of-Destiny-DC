Looking at the garden is comforting.
It's a good way to keep your spirits up.

Thanks to Master <Lion>, the
Draconis has finally returned.

[ENDBLOCK]
Have we been deceived
by <Lion> and <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
So the mastermind behind all 
this chaos finally has a name...
The Heavenly King <Miktran>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This Integrated Lens Cannon is
mankind's trump card.
We must protect it at all costs.

Don't let the magnificence of the

has great defenses.

[ENDBLOCK]

could breach its defenses.

The Queen hasn't made any

[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please, forgive us.
Our defenses weren't enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
We were overconfident in our
ability to defend the Draconis,
which allowed <Lion> to take it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
We are fully responsible.
What should we do now...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
You're saying that the CEO of the
Oberon Corporation, <Hugo>, 
was behind that broadcast?
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
To go to Mr. <Reynolds>'s lab,
take the left entrance.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that the firing mechanism
of Belcrant fell into the ocean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Until the Integrated Lens Cannon
is completed, I shall protect
this place no matter the cost.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
We must leave the fate
of the world to you.

Isn't this garden beautiful?

[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone in the castle
seems to be on edge.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
How did the war start and
how do we make it stop?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
They say that it's dangerous
to go outside the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The lens from all over the world
will be collected in this garden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, do you see that?
There's a hole in the sky!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the construction site
of the Integrated Lens Cannon
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon nears
completion. It's more important
than ever to continue collecting lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon is complete.
All that's left is to carry out the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Commander <Ritora>, I will never
forget all that you have taught me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please, for Commander <Ritora>'s 
sake, you must take down <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> is not taking
visitors at this time.

Don't fret, the best researchers our
country has to offer are at your disposal.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
