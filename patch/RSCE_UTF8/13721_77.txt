[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hahaha.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just a housewife's chat...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you. I haven't seen your face
around here, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm from the city of
Cyril in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, this is
your husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, am I !?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, my husband is
in Cyril.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right,
I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, don't worry. What are you
talking about here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
It's already decided for the aunts'
well-end meeting!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now, I'm talking about
General <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a little scary, isn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's true that some people
do think that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
But he's a very popular person
in Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That man?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Even though he is a
civilian employee, he is the one
who thinks about safety and
happiness first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a surprising fact. The next
time we meet, We'll make fun of
this story.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Making fun of me, <Mary>...
Are you <Rutee> now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to say to our customers,
but we are not currently
cashing lenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, this will run out of Gald.
[ENDBLOCK]

ask why!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to say to our customers,

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, we... that, I have to get
rid of my debt by tomorrow...
do I have to?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do
with the question?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to get rid of our
debt right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Otherwise, there may not
be a tomorrow
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you say so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I knew that I couldn't cash
it, so please tell me the reason.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
You can see it by going to the
house of General Oberon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s House?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!

It seems that the platoon headed for

what happened?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I was stabbed by
a bee on my way to the temple and
had a hard time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion, don't forget to bring the
Panacea Bottle when you go.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Don't forget your Panacea bottle

[ENDBLOCK]
This is <Lion>.
Thank you, for everything you do!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The city is peaceful again.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
As a result, I heard that it was
a battle that protected the world.

As expected, <Lion>!

It is our job to

Hey Mama. Let's go on a picnic
next vacation.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, <Lion>'s fans have
increased, but I was the first
to like it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey Mama. Let's go on a picnic
next vacation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
There are a lot of soldiers in
the city. I wonder why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish <Lion> could beat
all the bad guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I went to the castle and left the
lens. I was also helpful, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Lion>? I was just
talking about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You're <Lion>? Well, even if you
look closely, he's a beautiful boy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard it, <Lion>!
It seems to have fulfilled
the great duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, my God. Don't call out to me.
<Lion> is really cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw the rumored <Lion>.
Hey, he was a beautiful boy
who fell in love with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
According to the rumors of the
soldiers, <Lion> has played a
major role again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen <Lion> lately, I
wonder if he's gone somewhere
far away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Where did <Lion>go in such
a difficult time?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
There are rumors that <Lion> was
a bad guy, but I don't believe it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Make a hole in that
damn outer shell!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You will never lose!

[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I want <Lion> to get ahead. It's
not the age of the Seven Generals
anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if I'll dry
my futon today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I think <Lion> will be elected
for the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I want <Lion> to get ahead. It's
not the age of the Seven Generals

[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel that the
castle is busy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
The voice you hear from the sky
is familiar to you
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that it was the general
manager of Oberon that was
broadcasting from the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what will happen to
Seinegald from now on...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Please. Make the world
a battle cry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Rumor has it that a vehicle called
the Draconis was attacked by monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that it was in the process
of carrying a very important secret!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there are any interesting rumors. 
 I have no time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There are rumors that the two countries
have jointly buried something in
the hammers of Seinegald and Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Nowadays, wherever you go into the city,
you can carry it with <Lion> Magnus.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's strange that you shouldn't be
rumored if you're an unidentified
young boy and you have a good arm.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if there are any interesting rumors. 
 I have no time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that the Draconis crashed
into the mountains...Is it okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you guys know the situation?
Tell me what's going on!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If the sunlight disappears, the
ground will freeze in a blink of
an eye...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you making a secret weapon
in the castle to pierce the
outer shell?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn, why... When I saw that
light, tears came out.

Well <Lion>, looks like we're in

I bet I can learn a lot
about the sword from you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a handshake!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Make no mistake.
You and I? We are NOT equals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't stand laid-back, careless,
overly-friendly people like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected from the
promising Hedge Knight.
Won't even shake hands
with us filthy commoners, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Straylize Temple is
North of Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a village
called Armeida along the way.
Let's head for there, first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have my doubts about this person...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The inhabitants of the city
are also quite upset.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No wonder.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you were shown such an aerial
city and even attacked...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sordian Masters! What the
hell is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow... such a huge building is
floating in the sky!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
And that intense light! What a
tremendous amount of technology!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, why are you so flirting
when your country is destroyed?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indiscriminate crustal fracturing
weapon Bergland.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the true nature of the
light released from Dycroft.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The purpose is to destroy the ground,
as it is in the street.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said the aerial city was used
in the Tenchi war...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Aeth'er Wars...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I have no choice but to tell
you the truth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
A thousand years ago, there was a
great war involving all humankind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was the ground forces to which we
belonged and as such the Heavenly
Army of the aerial city.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the Aeth'er War...! It wasn't
just a legend, was it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni played 
a big role in the Aeth'er War.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was,"A sword caught in a
worldwide calamity".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I 'm sorry I didn't
say anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
We wanted to erase the memory of
the Aeth'er war from the
history of mankind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not to repeat, the mistakes
of the past.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
But as a result, the aerial
city has been revived...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
People of the earthly world!
Do you see our power?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
What you see above you is the
aerial city of the Aeth'er War.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
That we have revived from a
thousand years long sleep!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
We do not forgive at all.
No exceptions are allowed.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It does not allow the people of
the earthly world who can only
crawl on the ground like insects.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I will confine everything on the
earthly world to the darkness.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait with trembling expectations!
Mwahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Hugo>. Are you going to pretend
to be the king of the heavenly
world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
The way he talks is
like that man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What should I do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if you use the Draconis, you
can not reach that aerial city...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there no way for us to compete?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, not yet!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
As it is... Can I be left alone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can you hear me, <Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who will make you like it!
Who will do what you want!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will definitely be rewarded...!
<Lion>'s enemies will definitely be taken!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you understand!
Remember, <Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
That spirit, young master.
well said!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That kind of...It can't be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, this voice
is unmistakable.
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian team, it's not a
case of depressed!
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
We still have the potential!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Who?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mercurius <Ritora>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was the one who once led
us as the commander of the
ground forces.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
In case of an emergency, I also
transcribed my personality to
the core crystal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where does your voice come from...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
The communication function that is
built into me is being used.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I'm in the heart of Radisrol.
The strategy meeting is carried
out immediately from this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gather the Swordian team and
hurry to Radisrol!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is the first call order
in a thousand years.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you'll get by, right?
We can still do something
about it, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, <Stahn> Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be afraid under any
circumstances! Use all means
to accomplish your mission!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the Swordian team!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, I understand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, let's head
right out away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have already picked up the sea
dragon. Try going outside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
Radisrol was moved to the sea.
Waiting for arrival.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Excellency, I would like to
work with them to gather information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, you have permission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew. I thought I'd be able to
go home soon, but I didn't go
that way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to see Atamoni's
Eye sealed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to the advice of the
Swordians, we were able to
create a perfect sealing facility.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
In the future, the troops of Japan,
Seingard, and both countries will
also be stationed. Rest assured.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I did everything I could do in
this era. I have no choice but
to believe it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I and <Chelsea>,
will return through Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, please come visit us
again in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Feel free to drop in at the castle.
You guys are always welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please leave <Mary> and
others to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I'll go visit
them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Until then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Then I will return to
the temple soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...It was really hard. Good work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't all like that. When it
was over, it was a fun trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
For me, who knew only inside
the temple, it was a good opportunity
to know the outside world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because everyone gave me
an opportunity. I am grateful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Likewise. Thanks to you,
it really helped me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well then, good luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Stahn>. Excuse Me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must apologize, I'm sorry
I have to say goodbye, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The next time we meet, 
I'll be stronger. 
Please look forward to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no guarantee that I
will be here when you return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I find a better person,
I'll switch quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez. You could feel a little sad
I'm going...Well then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Ah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos> won't show it himself, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, what are you going to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What else? I'll
await further orders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've done a lot already. You
should take some time to rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such is my duty
as a Hedge Knight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad I was able to travel with
you, <Lion>. We went through a lot,
but it was fun.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you mimic me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Come on, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all that, you still
dislike me that much?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I consider you to be
a good friend, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't waste your breath.
I'll say this one more time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't stand laid-back, careless,
overly-friendly people like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...But...fine, I suppose
I can make a small exception.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is kinda nice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
..Hmph.
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Stahn>, the Draconis is ready.
We can depart at any time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I should say goodbye to <Rutee>...
Wonder where she went?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw her in the
castle a while ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll go look for her.
Excuse me, can you wait for a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are <Stahn> and <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't butt in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's about young master's older sister.
Do you not care about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
... I don't care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, <Rutee> and I are
essentially strangers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Rather than that. Let's go back
to the mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> is waiting.

<TAG_007>「称号の説明」
称号とはキャラクターにセットする事の出来る、
キャラクターパラメータのひとつです。
具体的なセット方法は次の通りです。
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>メインメニューを開いた後、キャラクターの
ステータスを表示します。
その画面のまま<Square_ani>を押すと、キャラクターの
ステータス表示を切り替える事が出来ます。

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>ステータスの一番上に、「称号」と書かれた
ページがあります。その画面で<Triangle_ani>を押すと、
取得した称号を切り替える事が出来ます。

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>称号の使い道には、二通りあります。
ひとつ目は……
「称号をセットして、街人に話し掛けよう」
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>街人の中には、称号をセットして話し掛ける事で、
あなたに興味を持つ人がいます。街人に何度か
話し掛けた際、不思議な言動をする事があります。
その時は、持っている称号をセットし直してから、
もう一度話し掛けてみましょう。
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>ヒント：街人に話し掛けた際、プレイヤーの
頭の上に「？」が出る事があります。
その時は、街人のセリフと関連しそうな
称号をセットして、再度、話し掛けてみましょう。
何か嬉しい事が起こるかもしれません。
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>使い道のふたつ目は……
「ステータス画面をかっこ良くしよう」
集めた称号の中で、もし気に入ったものがあれば、
セットしてステータス画面をかっこ良く演出しましょう。
