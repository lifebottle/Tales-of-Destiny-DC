[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, please forgive
me. Hahaha.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, we're
just gabbing...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you there. I haven't seen your
face around here before, have I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who knows. I'm from the city
of Cyril in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
My, is this your husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nope. My husband
is in Cyril.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? Sorry for
the misunderstanding.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it. More
importantly, what were you
talking about just now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing in particular. Just the
idle gossip of older women.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
The topic of the hour
is General <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a little scary, isn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's true that some
people do think that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
But he's a very popular
person in Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Despite working for the
military, he's always concerned about
the safety and happiness of others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What an unexpected tidbit. Next time
we see him, we'll have to tease him
about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tease him? <Mary>... That's
totally a <Rutee> thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
This pains me to say to our customers,
but we are not currently cashing lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh... How come?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm... about that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on! At this rate,
we'll run out of Gald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>. I can't believe
this. Ask him why!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
This pains me to say to our customers,
but we are not currently cashing lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't even...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-we... uhm, we only have
until tomorrow to pay off
our debts... or else...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of question is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to settle this
debt right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Otherwise, there may not
be a tomorrow for us...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if that were true...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I'd like to know the reason
why we can't cash in our lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Shopkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
...If you go to the Oberon CEO's
house, you'll quickly see why.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s House?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It can't be...!

I hope <Lion> wipes out
all the bad guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
I went to the castle and delivered
some lens. I was helpful, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Lion>? I was just
talking about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you <Lion>? Wow, you're a
beautiful guy even up close!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! I heard you've completed
your important mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my, I can't believe you're
talking to me, <Lion>. You're
really a cutie, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw the rumored <Lion> the
other day. I had no idea he
was so beautiful.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK] 
A soldier told me that that
<Lion> has completed another
important mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen <Lion> lately, I wonder
if he's gone to some far-off place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, where have you run off
to at such a terrible time?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
There are rumors that <Lion> 
was a bad guy, but I don't 
believe them.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Make a hole in that

[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you dare lose!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I wish you great success. 
After all, the era of the Seven
Generals is over.

[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if I'll dry
my futon today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I think <Lion> will soon be elected to

[ENDBLOCK]

it sounded familiar somehow?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that it was Oberon's
CEO who was broadcasting
from the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what will happen
to Seinegald now...

[ENDBLOCK]

<center>A thousand years ago, there was a
great war involving all humankind.

<center>It was between the Er'ther forces,
to which we belonged, and the Aetherian
Army of the aerial cities.

just a legend, was it?

<Dymlos>

<center>The Eye of Atamoni played a

<center>It was "the source of the great
calamity that befell the world."

<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry I didn't say anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We wanted to erase the memory of the
Aeth'er War from the history of mankind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>As to not repeat the 
mistakes of the past.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
But as a result, the Aeropoleis
have been revived...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
People of the world below!
Do you see our power?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>... What's he going to say?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Above you floats the Aeropoleis
from the time of the Aeth'er War!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
After a thousand years, we have
awakened them from their slumber!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Forgiveness shall not be offered.
No exceptions will be provided.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You fools below can only crawl
upon the Earth like insects!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
That which you call home will be

Tremble before our might and

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Hugo>...! Are you going to pretend
to be the king of the Aetherians!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do we do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even with the Draconis, we

<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, let's move out!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Leviathan awaits you outside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Radisrol roams the seas.
Go out and meet it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Excellency, I would
like to work with them to
gather information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, you have permission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew. I didn't think that
would take so long, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's very important that
we seal away the Eye of
Atamoni properly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to the Swordians'
guidance, we were able to
construct the perfect
sealing facility.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
From now on, the armies of both
our country and Seinegald are to
be stationed there. Please rest
assured.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>We've done all we can in this era. 
We have no choice but to have faith in you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then <Chelsea> and I will
return through Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, please come visit
us again in Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Feel free to drop in at the castle.
You are always welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please leave <Mary> and
the others to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I'll see you 
guys again soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Until then, take care!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'll be returning to
the temple soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>... I know it's been
tough for you. Thank you
for your hard work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't all like that. When
all is said and done, I had
a lot of fun on this trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
As one who only knew the inside of the
temple, it was a great opportunity for
me to see the outside world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm truly thankful to everyone. Without
them, I wouldn't have had this chance
in the first place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm grateful to you too, <Philia>.
Thanks to you, I also learned
lots of new things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well then, I bid you farewell.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Stahn>, if I may...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry I have to say goodbye,
but I've got to go now, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The next time we meet, 
I'll be stronger. Please
look forward to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>There is no guarantee that I
will be here when you return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>If I find a better master, I won't
hesitate to choose them instead.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez. You could at least act like
you're sad to see me go. Oh well!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Dymlos> isn't being honest
about his feelings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, what are you 
going to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What else? I'll await 
further orders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've done a lot already. You
should take some time to rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such is my duty as
a Hedge Knight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad I was able to travel with
you, <Lion>. We went through a lot,
but it was fun.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't mimic me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Come on, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all that, you still
dislike me that much?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I consider you to be
a good friend, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Don't waste your breath.
I'll say this one more time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't stand laid-back, careless,
overly-friendly people like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... Fine, I suppose I can
make a small exception.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is kinda nice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hmph.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Stahn>, the Draconis is ready.
We can depart at any time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I should say goodbye to <Rutee>...
Wonder where she went?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw her in the castle
a little while ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll go look for her. Excuse
me, can you wait for a little bit?
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Rerise is no longer possible due
to the absence of Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a weird guy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I wonder if there's something going
on between <Stahn> and <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not something
I care to intrude on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>But your older sister might be involved
with someone! Don't you wanna find out?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, not really.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, <Rutee> and I are
basically strangers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, forget about it. Let's
go back to the mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> is waiting for me.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
