If you leave the city and head north,
you'll find the capital city, Kalviola.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
...Why, do I have to,
teach this to foreigners!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk> Foundation's office? I don't
know anything about that!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald was attacked?
Suck it up!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Did they attack Calvalese too? Why the hell not!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky has closed up...

It's only one.

[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no! Don't talk
to me like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky lit up. I'm scared...
Help me...
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
How could they do this to us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I can trust you guys?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
That <Baruk> guy, looks like
someone I used to know...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well, It's probably
just my imagination.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk> Foundation? ...hmm.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen <Baruk> lately. 
Not that I care.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Why should Calvalese be subjected to
the same treatment as the stranger
countries?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't matter if you're a stranger
or not. I'm looking forward to working
with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
They want weapons to defend themselves,
but they don't make enough money.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Baruk> Foundation office? I don't
know. Even if I knew, I don't have to
tell you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
What is that thing that looks
like an island floating in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know if it's the effect of the
sky, but the monsters have been getting
more violent lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
In times like these, I want to have
a weapon that will protect me at
all costs
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
The owner of the weapon shop gave
me some stuff for free. In exchange,
he asked me to protect the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to tell me.
Let's do it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Seeing the ship up close makes me sad,
so I watch it from a distance like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
.....
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
People who can get on a boat and
leave the island are so lucky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
At this rate, I bet I can do anything,
anywhere and not get into trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I can only cheer for you, though.
Good luck to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. This is no
place for foreigners.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Where are we? The city of Cherik,
the port city to Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Where are we? The city of Cherik,
the port city to Calvalese.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the port city of Calvalese...
Oh, no, I'm not talking about that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry I ever called you a
stranger. Please save the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?	You don't have a copy
of Definite Warfare?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You have honed your skills.
Please take this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
This shows the "Definite Strike"
linkage that is effective
against monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Make use of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]

by setting [Definite Strike] to 
"ON" from the Customize menu
in the Main menu.

[ENDBLOCK]

Hone your skill a little more
and then come back.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
