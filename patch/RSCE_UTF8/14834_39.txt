<TAG_007>It's a small space, but it's
purrrfect for a cat nap.

[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I never imagined that
this day would come.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a good experience for me
to take back to my homeland.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Glowmoss]?
That soft green glow...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It invokes such a sense
of mewitching beauty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Purrhaps I'm losing it
in my advanced age.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I see mew've found the [Will-o'-the-Wisp].
I understand the theory behind them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
And that's exactly why I can't stop
pawndering about the souls of the dead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Black Worm]?
That thing was as quick as
it was abnormal-looking.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Finding it would be impawssible
for someowne with my tired old eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Pah, it wasn't meowch
of a looker anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
So mew've found the [Tablet of Laws].
The cat burglars who were looking to pawn it
off during all that chaos with <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
meowst've gotten hit during
Belcrant's bombardment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what I figure, anyway. Now
they're suffuring the catsequences.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Tear Flower]?
It's as deadly as it is beautiful...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Just like meowr's truly!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the
[Big Horned Beetle].
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a purrfect example of
how looks can be deceiving.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Skull Crag]?
Not only does it look creepy, it also
lets out a blood-currdling scream!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Speaking fur everyone,
that is. I'm no scaredy-cat.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Quick Cricket]!
They really do live a quick life.
Must be purretty rough for them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Burning Mallet]?
Don't furget about its heat blasts.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay three meters away
or you'll get burrnt.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
So, Mew found the
[Mountaineer's Flower]?
It purrfurs high places,
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
so consider yourself
the cat's meow if you
spot one anywhere else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the
[Moist Mouse]?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you know this
is how the phrase
"like a drowned rat"
got popular?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
...Cat believe
you fell for that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Leech Frog].
They slurp up people's blood...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's pawsitively outrageous!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew found the [Rashweed]?
They're actually my favorite food.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Just kitten! If you ate
one of those your
tummy would break.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I see mew found the [Happiness Bird].
I got my claws on one too a long time ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I was happy, but
fur some reason
it felt empty.
So I let it go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's when I realized
I wasn't the kind of Katz
that could be sathissfied
with happiness given by
someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
So here's what
I've got for you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a plant growing near
Rodeon that's meowt of this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not spurrling the surprise.
meow'll have to see it for yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a spawt near Deimos
where grudges left by earthly
creatures float about in the air.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Best not speak of
them too catsually...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew wouldn't want them
getting any angrier...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I spawtted an incredibly
swift creature near Josaia.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It's almost impurrceptibly fast.
Good luck trying to catch it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I spied a treasure clawst by
the Phandarian royal family
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
in the hairea near Ignasea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Meow why would it be over there...?
The world may never know, purrhaps.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
A beautiful flower grows
near Josaia that's used to
make dangerous meowdicines.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Beauty and danger
all in one package...
Just like meowr's truly!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a bug on the Outer Shell.
It's purrobably somewhere near
the city with a research facility.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
...Don't hiss at
me if I'm wrong.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a spawt near Dycroft
where you can hear a
blood-currdling scream.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, but I couldn't
find the purrpetrator.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew think I got scared
and ran off with my tail
between my legs?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I searched the whole area
but came up empty-clawed!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's an insect near
Deimos that really makes
you apurreciate the
furragility of life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew should find it too so you
can share that appurreciation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I felt a burrning heat near
the city that controlled
the Guardian Dragon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It was too hot to stick around
so I don't know what clawsed it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
I spawted a flower that only
grows in high places near
the city that used to be
a meowlitary stronghold.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew don't know which
one that was? It was...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
T-The one that used to be
a meowlitary stronghold!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew don't even know
which one that is?
...That is unfurrtunate.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a creature that's
never been seen before in
the area furrounding Rodeon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
How is it even pawssible for
animals to evolve this quickly!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Watch out if you're traveling
clawse to Dycroft, there's a
dangerous animal lurking around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
If meow're not careful
you might end up
getting really hurt!
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Dangerous plants have
spurrung up in the area
near one of the cities after
breaking out of an
expurrimentation plant.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew should be careful
if you're walking around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Mew aren't sure
which city that was?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
It was the one with the...
expurrimentation plant...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Cat's got my tongue...
I cat remember either.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
Meow'll find a creature near
the city with the research lab
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
that can paward people
with their deepest desires.
And its exact location is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Katz
[ENDBLOCK]
...Only fur me to know~

The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople

interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's

Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
