[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you're a young man of Liena.
When you're tired, don't hesitate to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Well well, it's been a while
since you last stayed at home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
EEEEEK!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong <Lilith>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was someone peeking
through the window!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? Did you
see their face?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
No..I didn't get a very
good look at them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha. I'll go see if I can
find any suspicious people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK, I brought all the suspicious
people around the house that I saw.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good work, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, confess!
Who was it?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right!
Confess immediately!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're under suspicion
too you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
M-Me too!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got nothing to do with this.
It was <Bacchus> right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't me!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea either.
Was probably this guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't MEEE!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah, it wasn't <Bacchus>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, <Stahn>!
You understand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that true, big bro?
Well in that case...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, the culprit is in here!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What..?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you serious!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
What!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I-It wasn't me though...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
OK, who the heck peeked
into the bathroom then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Peeked into the...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
...Bathroom?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Huh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you show your
true colors!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
True colors..?
So it was this kid?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, this kid's the
perpetrator in the Great
Bathroom Peeper Mystery!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was gathering everyone up,
I didn't dare explain exactly why
I was doing it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Upon seeing <Lilith> angry,
these two reflexively denied
any wrong doing at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
B-But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
They just knew that <Lilith>
being angry was really bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, give it up already!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this true?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes. I'm the one who peeked
into your bathroom window...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got a real cool big
brother. What's your name?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be sure to remember
that name well! My name is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Just what the heck are
you doing, you idiot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, anyway, That was
really cool, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I was real suprised there,
it's like you turned into a
completely different person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-Nah...I just..was actin' like
the main character in a book
I read a long time ago...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the best, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? I'm just passing through.
I have no business in the bathroom.
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, man, you gonna be out late? 
...This is my chance!
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, man, you gonna be out late? 
...This is my chance!
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo, there's been some weird people 
hanging around here lately!
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell? I am so lost.
I'm totally screwed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a strange one. You don't
seem like you belong here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care about the war between
the heavens and earth. I have my
own battles to deal with.
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this conflict all about?
I...have no idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Villager
[ENDBLOCK]
Every day is another climactic
moment in my life.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
