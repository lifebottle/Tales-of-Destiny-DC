<Stahn>. You're in

Do you remember me?
It's <Ilene> <Rembrandt>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, will you please 
back off? Don't get in the
way of Mr. <Hugo>'s plans.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the plan? You're trying
to ruin the earth for your own
reasons!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that <Rutee>'s voice.
I knew you were there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Listen, <Stahn>. I'm going to ask
<Hugo> to relocate the people of
the earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, we can't save all of them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that anyone who is qualified
can become an inhabitant of the new
world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
And those who are not accepted 
are told to die on earth.

He imitates God while in

that attitude is arrogant?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's exactly the idea of a 
celestial being. <Ilene> is a 
fine celestial being.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not going to back down.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes. It looks like the talks have
gone in the wrong direction.
That's too bad.

<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not kidding. How dare you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!	I'm going to get
you to that woman!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, ok.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Watch it. I'm going to remind the
rich and hardscrabble how hard 
life can be!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
