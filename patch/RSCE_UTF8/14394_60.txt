[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>! Where you going?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>I'm off to save the world!
Nowhere special...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
The world!? You, <Stahn>?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, yeah.
...Kinda...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't lie to me. You're just running
away from home again, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's true!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Sometimes I wonder if you'll
ever grow up, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I figure if you did, you
wouldn't be my <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez, you're awful! Haha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder that sometimes, myself.
Based on what I've seen, you'll 
be a child forever, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh shut up, <Dymlos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Ooh, keeping secrets
from me, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? No, I'm not!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess that's to be expected.
You've got such a pretty girl
with you, after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
//TODO
Wh-What? N-No!
I-It's not l-like
that at all!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, I see. Well, <Stahn>, I guess
I underestimated you. I thought
you'd never grow up, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
You've become quite
the man, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I better not fall behind...
I can't be a little girl
forever!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah well. Have a safe trip, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
The nerve of that man, up and
vanishing like that! Who d'you
turn to at a time like this!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
The nerve of that man, up and
vanishing like that! Who d'you
turn to at a time like this!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie, there's no need to fear.
Boy Detective <Stahn> is on the case!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah, You almost look halfway
reliable when you act like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You should totally consider
doing it more often.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My dear <Rutee>, it is said that
there is a limit to all things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew, okay, I'm sick of
acting like that now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, Auntie Maggie, when did you
realize that Uncle Bob was missing?
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if I recall right, that idiot was
right dead center of where that big
ol' blast from the sky hit.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
At least, that's what
someone said they
saw.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-In that case,
Uncle Bob is...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah, I know for a fact,
that fool ain't dead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
I ain't clingin' to hope
or nothin', I just know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha. We'll track
him down for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear, that man is beyond human.
He has the devil's luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've got nothing to
go on though, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if what she meant was the 
Belcrant Cannon, then... He's on
the Aethersphere?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You come up with the
most ridiculous ideas,
you know that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I have a feeling we'll
run into him at some point.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got famously sharp
intuition, you know! It'll
be fine!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
I probably shouldn't take her
into someone else's house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
I really shouldn't leave town
with her following me.

That's quite the cutie you got

Hey, aren't you <Stahn>'s...
Wh-Whaaat!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>! Who's
responsible for
all of this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man

Is it Seinegald? Phandaria?
It's not Fitzgald, is it!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What is all this? Where
did this come from?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I miss the days when things
were nice and peaceful.

Hey, <Stahn>. I've heard a lot

Ahh, it hatched from an egg.
Whew, that's a relief.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll go shopping
for some fresh meat.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if the sky's weird, it's
still fun to play Rock Rally
on the road to Neustadt.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant

The only thing I look forward to

is Rock Rally.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant

You should see how much
fun it is, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll share this fun
with you, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to show you
how to have fun, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Try kicking a rock that's fallen in
front of the village to Neustadt.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you should give
it a shot first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time, it'll be twice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time, it'll be three.

You've come a long way

You don't want to get hungry

Oh <Lilith>, that's a Pocket Dragon
you got there, ain't it?
[ENDBLOCK]

It's said that their babies
bring more happiness
than the Goddess!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
You still haven't heard from
your brother, have you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Most of our village is self-sufficient.
Even the women do the heavy lifting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Till and plant, till and plant...
Eh? Well, if it ain't <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
You think I got a lotta energy? Hah!
Somethin' like this is nothin'!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Most of our village is self-sufficient.
Even the women do the heavy lifting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
You ought to live while you're
young! I know I sure did!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
It just don't feel right, like the
sky's lookin' down on us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about the village.
You do your thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be fine because I'm still young.
Your gramps is a whole 'nother
story!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
He took that other monster
out like it was nothin'!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Me an' Thomas took care of the
monsters attacking the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen this kind of dragon
before, but it's pretty cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, are you its mama?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus> went to Neustadt
on an errand for your
grandfather, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
He hasn't come home yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, you came from Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, you haven't seen
a pointy-haired guy passed out on
the road, have you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
A pointy-haired guy...?
...No, I haven't.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. I'm actually kinda
relieved to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you remember
when we used to pick
flowers in our garden?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
We used to play pranks all the
time. How papa would scold us!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, is this someone you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, if you ever want to come
back to the village, you're always
welcome...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's voice was
that in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Will we only be able to
share stories in the
dark from now on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish we coulda talked
under the sun at least
one more time, <Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to do what I can to help.
I have to protect the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>? What's that monster
doing in the village?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you need help, just let me know.
It's my destiny to protect you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah, <Lilith>... Why won't
you look my way?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of that
guy for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted you to stay in the village.
You made <Lilith> sad by leaving...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alas, it can't be helped! Don't
worry about <Lilith>. I'll look
after her for you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take
care of <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, don't you want to come
back to the village instead of
wandering around outside?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure <Lilith> would be
a lot happier if you did.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know <Lilith> will
be safe with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, you must be having
a hard time with <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you staying out
of trouble, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was the one who gathered up
all the lens in the village and
carried them to Neustadt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just don't waste
any of them, okay?

<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will

to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick

<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's up, <Bacchus>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Are these the people who
are traveling with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that means... <Lilith>'s
with you too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm... <Stahn>? <Lilith>? Can I
talk to you about something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll leave you
guys alone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What'd you want to talk about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-Well... Ever since
<Lilith> left, I've felt
like...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Like there's a hole in
my heart, y'know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I find myself thinking about
you all the time, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Oh, uhm, I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
If <Lilith> disappears too, I...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I become the butt of
everyone's jokes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Listen! If there's no one lower
than me on the totem pole...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then that makes me the
village idiot, now!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big bro, may I borrow
that for a second?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? What do you-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>, you BONEHEAD!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha! <Bacchus> the Bonehead,
I like the sound of that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!
I almost died!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then again, I actually
feel better...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll be patient. I'm
counting on you, big bro.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
To be known as "He who lived
to love" until the day I die...
That is my dream!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
To be known as "He who lived

all of a sudden?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I get what you're
sayin', <Bacchus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aha! Someone who
understands me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You got it! I live for
love, too, you see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hello, General <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you come to
see Gramps?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Is
Thomas here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait here a sec.
I'll go get him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, <Lewein>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a long time,
Thomas. I'm glad to
see you're doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, the years are
piling up though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I may ask, where is...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
My wife... passed
some time ago..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... That's truly 
unfortunate. I am
sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You knew Grandma, 
General <Lewein>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, of course
I did. After all...
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's rare to see Thomas
get flustered like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you see, <Stahn>... I was quite
fond of your grandmother back in
the day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woaaah! So you mean, I might
have been the grandson of a
general of Seinegald!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be stupid, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that were the case, you
wouldn't even be here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know about that.
<Stahn> could have very
well been my grandson.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't hate the idea, but
I'm still perfectly happy
with Gramps and <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah, a man's love for his
family!! It's so inspirin'!!<x00>
