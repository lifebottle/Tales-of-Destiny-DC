<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why? To restore the glory of the
Aeth'er Empire to this world, of course!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thus begins a new chapter!
Thus begins a new Aeth'er War!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did we finally find
the Eye of Atamoni!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's just a 3D image. 
It's probably a representation of the 
current state of the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
That is far enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
There he is....
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
To think that you would march
into Belcrant. Your vain
struggle is quite remarkable. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>, your plan ends here. 
You no longer have free
reign to do as you please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The allies you relied on are gone. 
You are all that remains.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you ready?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't stand a chance.
This is where we put an
end to your war!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha-ha-ha!
You cannot achieve victory!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are all so simple-minded.
Didn't you hear from <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
From <Lion>...? What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
The amount of power in my possesion.
You didn't even ask him, did you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I remember how that young swordsman
cowered on the floor and begged for my
forgiveness!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't insult <Lion>! He would 
never do such a thing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
//TODO retranslate this
Hehehe...such an anticipated crescendo.
Finally, a worthy opponent in battle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> was not a challenge. But now,
I finally get to use this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordians...
You'll recognize this sword!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no way...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said <Belserius>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lost during the last war between heaven
and earth... It's the Sixth Swordian...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is it there, that's...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Belserius> was secretly transported
to the surface by the remnants of the
Heavenly Army.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Safeguarded in Calvalese,
now in my possession!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
But <Belserius> must have been 
damaged in that battle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whether or not it is damaged will
become clear once we meet in battle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Belserius>, is that really you?
If you can hear me, answer me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you ready, you insects?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You shall fall to the
great blade <Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now... it's over...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't think we could go
toe-to-toe with <Belserius>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, isn't something strange
going on with the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. The glow is growing stronger!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, look! <Belserius>
is glowing as well!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What in the world is
happening to <Belserius>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You still have fight left?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe... Did you really
think that was enough to
defeat me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter how much you rats
fight back, you cannot compete
with me, the supreme one!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as I have <Belserius>,
I am invincible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You... Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I noticed something... strange earlier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you really <Hugo>? ...You're
really someone else, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, what are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I demand an answer!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
My, my. for such a lowly creature 
to have such good instincts.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That...that voice!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that you are aware, I shall
share with you my true form!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Aaaaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>!

Hehe...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible, that's...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I descend!
I, the King of Heaven, have descended
upon this world once more!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can... how can this be!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can... <Miktran>... 
just appear like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
The technology of our celestial
army was superior to that of you
earthlings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you have a host body and
the Eye of Atamoni, one can
cheat death and be resurrected!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is also the power
of the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
To disregard the human
body in such a way....
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything that's happened...
It was all your doing, wasn't it!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
And what if it was?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordians!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
You thought you were the ones 
who were supposed to have won 
the war, didn't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
How naive! During the war, I
projected my own consciousness
into <Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Unbeknownst to all of you,
<Belserius> was my possession,
and I lurked within it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pretending to be broken was humiliating,
but thanks to "him" I accumulated some
very... useful information.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
The former personality of <Belserius>
was quite the brainiac, wasn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean Karell...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was called Karell...? Well, whatever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how you were able to 
develop the mirror barrier...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
And when <Hugo> unearthed me, I took
over his consciousness as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
All this time, he has served
as my most precious puppet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> was just a lowly earthling,
after all. He was nothing without me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Unforgivable!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I may not be the biggest fan
of <Hugo>... But I'll never forgive
you for what you did to him!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh heh heh... It seems that
Belcrant is ready to fire.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
The outer shell will be 
complete. The filthy earth shall
be consumed by darkness!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Under my rule, a paradise for the
chosen ones will be established
in the heavens!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not gonna let you do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph, a useless exercise in futility.
...Allow me to show you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haaaaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Light from <Belserius>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
//TODO check second line
Such tremendous pressure... <Belserius>'
power is off the charts!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
//TODO
Now that the cannon has been
primed, I shall revel in the
destruction it brings!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter how many Swordian
Masters exist, none can stand
against me!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible... This can't be...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are not my equal.
Do you understand now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Watch as the earth is shrouded 
in eternal darkness!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Belcrant, fire!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The outer shell is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bahaha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this the end...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bahaha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've come so far...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dammit!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha! It's a complete victory
for my heavenly army!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to make your death quick.
You should be grateful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
I, the King of Heaven, will 
personally deliver my judgment!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're giving me special treatment?
I'm so grateful, it brings tears to
my eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> has always been concerned
about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even after taking over his
body, a sliver of <Hugo>'s
consciousness remained.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I could sense every bit
of pain felt within his heart.
He agonized over you constantly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
He held out hope that there 
was still a way he could be
a father to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a vulgar way to think!
I couldn't but be amused!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
And there's nothing you can do 
about it, is there? How unfortunate.
Ha-ha-ha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop screwing around...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that celestial beings 
are no different from earthly beings,
but you're the exception.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have no humanity!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's disgusting to laugh at how 
families care for each other!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How can you possibly be better 
than the humans on Earth?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shut your mouth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
You cheeky little worm.
I'll deal with you next.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh...Uh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, pull yourself together!
<Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, are you ready?
<Rutee> Katrea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> Gilchrist's dear daughter!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fa...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mu...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on...?
I can't... move...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>... Can you 
hear me...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s voice!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's happening...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't have much time. 
You need to get out of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to detach Belcrant.
Quickly...to the surface...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
You! Do remnants of <Hugo>'s
consciousness still reside
within this body?! Such impudence!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>... You bastard...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't hold on much longer...
Hurry... before I'm gone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
To call out to me as... your father...
filled me with such joy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You didn't have any...
I didn't... give you anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, let's do what <Hugo> says.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank... you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep... <Rutee> safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>
[ENDBLOCK]
Graaaaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father... FATHER!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
