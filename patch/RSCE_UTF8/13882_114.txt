[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You found the [Glowmoss]?
That soft green glow...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It invokes such a sense
of bewitching beauty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Wonder if I'm losing it
in my advanced age.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I see you've found the [Will-o'-the-Wisp].
I understand the theory behind them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
And that's exactly why I can't stop
thinking about the souls of the dead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You found the [Black Worm]?
That thing was as quick as
it was abnormal-looking.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Finding it would be quite the task
for someone with my tired old eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Pah, it wasn't much
of a looker anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So you've found the [Tablet of Laws].
The thieves who made off with it
during all that chaos with <Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
must've gotten hit during
Belcrant's bombardment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what I figure, anyway.
You reap what you sow.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let me share with
you an interesting story...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a plant growing near Rodeon
that's meowt of this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not spoiling the surprise. you'll
have to see it for yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I've witnessed it
with my own two eyes. Got a
tough bodyguard with me, see?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Not to mention a backpack full of
Holy Bottles and legs quick enough
to carry me away from any danger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a spot near Deimos
where grudges left by earthly
creatures float about in the air.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Best not speak of
them too casually...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Wouldn't want them
getting any angrier...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I've witnessed it
with my own two eyes. Got a

[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Not to mention a backpack full of

to carry me away from any danger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I spotted an incredibly swift
creature near Josaia.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The thing moves like lightning.
Good luck trying to catch it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I've witnessed it
with my own two eyes. Got a

[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Not to mention a backpack full of
Holy Bottles and legs quick enough
to carry me away from any danger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I spied a treasure lost by
the Phandarian royal family
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
in the vicinity of Ignasea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Now why would it be over there...?
The world may never know.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I've witnessed it

[ENDBLOCK]
This is the military vessel that
 <Clemente> is enshrined within.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It's called Radisrol. This ship
used to be very famous.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't know what we'll encounter inside.
<Philia> should wait on the Leviathan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I reckon that'd
be the safest place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That sound good, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay... well, we're off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Please be

[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
A fourth Swordian...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only... if only I had
that power, I...!
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>... Hear me, <Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That voice... that's definitely the
same voice I heard on the ship!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who calls out to me?
Where are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
 I await you further within this
place. Come to me, young <Philia>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Further... within...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That reminds me, <Philia>. You
sure caught up to us easily.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How'd you get past all the
danger without a Swordian?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I managed just fine with this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...A flask...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted to be of assistance,
so I came up with some new
weapons.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eek! Look out!
PHILIA BOMB!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, she killed it in one hit!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I may have been chosen
by <Clemente>, but I think
I'll continue to use these.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia> seems pretty strong
even without you, old man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-Well then, shall we get
back on the Leviathan?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
So this is Radisrol...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ritora>
[ENDBLOCK]
I await you in the
heart of Radisrol.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hey, <Atwight>. I have a
question about <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What he said... Is it true?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>...I don't have clear evidence,
but I think it's very likely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>He knew your mother's name,
after all. Besides...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>...I don't think he'd lie in
a situation like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, sorry, I'm coming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a status report. The zero-gravity
elevator is up and running.
[ENDBLOCK]
