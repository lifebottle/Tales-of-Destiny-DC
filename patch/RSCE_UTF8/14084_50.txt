[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been getting a lot of pocket 
change recently, so my wallet is 
heavy and hard to lug around.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me move it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I expected something a
lot worse than this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought monsters
were gonna pop out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Ah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aaahhhh, oh no! Quick!
Help pick it all up!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was worried that
was gonna happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm one gald short, 
where is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Found it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you shouldn't run 
around like that... if the cave floor
collapses we'll all be in trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll risk it for the biscuit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Huh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>. watch out!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S06>Wahhhhh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S06>Wahhhhh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S06><Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S06><Rutee>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! <Rutee>!
Are you alright?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We found some rope. Grab on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess I caused you guys
some trouble. Sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wasn't expecting such
an earnest apology.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Money is still super important
to me, but I’ll try to limit
myself from now on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'd been bad if I had
gotten seriously hurt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right. That's a
good way of looking at it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks. I don't want to
trouble everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
... Too much?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Too much!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Too much!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahaha, you said it together!
You really are similar to each other!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just how are <Stahn> and I
similar? Don't be so rude.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You saying that was more rude!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The atmosphere around 
<Rutee> has changed a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You might be right. Maybe
that's a good thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
On top of that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, <Philia>？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, they alright?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can hear their voices.
Sounds like they're okay, somehow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seriously, she's
always such a pain...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I think we should help them
instead of complaining about it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is a deep pit. Even with the
three of us, it'll be difficult
to get them out of it on our own.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
For now, let's return to Shiden.
We'll search for some rope, there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Well, OK...

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
