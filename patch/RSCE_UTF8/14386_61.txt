[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>! Where you going?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>I'm off to save the world!
Nowhere special...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
The world!? You, <Stahn>?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, yeah.
...Kinda...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't lie to me. You're just running
away from home again, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's true!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Sometimes I wonder if you'll
ever grow up, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
But I figure if you did, you
wouldn't be my <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez, you're awful! Haha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder that sometimes myself.
Based on what I've seen, you'll 
be a child forever, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh shut up, <Dymlos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Ooh, keeping secrets
from me, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? No, I'm not!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess that's to be expected.
You've got such a pretty girl
with you, after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
//TODO
Wh-What? N-No!
I-It's not l-like
that at all!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, I see. Well, <Stahn>, I guess
I underestimated you. I thought
you'd never grow up, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
You've become quite
the man, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I better not fall behind...
I can't be a little girl
forever!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah well. Have a safe trip, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
The nerve of that man, up and
vanishing like that! Who d'you
turn to at a time like this!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
The nerve of that man, up and
vanishing like that! Who d'you
turn to at a time like this!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie, there's no need to fear.
Boy Detective <Stahn> is on the case!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah, you almost look halfway
reliable when you act like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You should totally consider
doing it more often.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My dear <Rutee>, it is said that
there is a limit to all things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew, okay, I'm sick of
acting like that now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, Auntie Maggie, when did you
realize that Uncle Bob was missing?
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if I recall right, that idiot was
right dead center of where that big
ol' blast from the sky hit.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
At least, that's what
someone said they
saw.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-In that case,
Uncle Bob is...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah, I know for a fact,
that fool ain't dead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
I ain't clingin' to hope
or nothin', I just know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha. We'll track
him down for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear, that man is beyond human.
He has the devil's luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've got nothing to
go on though, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if what she meant was the 
Belcrant Cannon, then... He's on
the Aethersphere?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You come up with the
most ridiculous ideas,
you know that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I have a feeling we'll
run into him at some point.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got famously sharp
intuition, you know! It'll
be fine!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
I probably shouldn't take her
into someone else's house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
I really shouldn't leave town
with her following me.

Wh-Whaaat!?

I think I'll go shopping

Even if the sky's weird, it's

is Rock Rally.

You should see how much
fun it is, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll share this fun
with you, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to show you
how to have fun, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Try kicking a rock that's fallen in
front of the village to Neustadt.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you should give
it a shot first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time, it'll be twice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant

Next time, it'll be three.

You can't just walk by, <Stahn>.
Go ahead, take a look.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
You've come a long way

[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't want to get hungry

Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]

Oh <Lilith>, that's a Pocket Dragon
you got there, ain't it?
[ENDBLOCK]

than the Goddess!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
You still haven't heard from
your brother, have you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Most of our village is self-sufficient.
Even the women do the heavy lifting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Till and plant, till and plant...
Eh? Well, if it ain't <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
You think I got a lotta energy? Hah!
Somethin' like this is nothin'!

[ENDBLOCK]
You ought to live while you're
young! I know I sure did!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
It just don't feel right, like the
sky's lookin' down on us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about the village.
You do your thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be fine because I'm still young.
Your gramps is a whole 'nother
story!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

out like it was nothin'!
[ENDBLOCK]
Aunt Maggie
[ENDBLOCK]
Me an' Thomas took care of the
monsters attacking the village.

Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen this kind of dragon
before, but it's pretty cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, are you its mama?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus> went to Neustadt
on an errand for your
grandfather, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
He hasn't come home yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, you came from Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, you haven't seen
a pointy-haired guy passed out on
the road, have you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
A pointy-haired guy...?
...No, I haven't.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. I'm actually kinda
relieved to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you remember
when we used to pick
flowers in our garden?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
We used to play pranks all the
time. How papa would scold us!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, is this someone you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, if you ever want to come
back to the village, you're always
welcome...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's voice was
that in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Will we only be able to
share stories in the
dark from now on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish we coulda talked
under the sun at least
one more time, <Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to do what I can to help.
I have to protect the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>? What's that monster
doing in the village?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you need help, just let me know.
It's my destiny to protect you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah, <Lilith>... Why won't
you look my way?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of that
guy for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted you to stay in the village.
You made <Lilith> sad by leaving...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alas, it can't be helped! Don't
worry about <Lilith>. I'll look
after her for you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take
care of <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, don't you want to come
back to the village instead of
wandering around outside?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure <Lilith> would be
a lot happier if you did.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know <Lilith> will
be safe with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, you must be having
a hard time with <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you staying out
of trouble, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was the one who gathered up
all the lens in the village and
carried them to Neustadt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just don't waste
any of them, okay?

Hey, are you running
an errand for <Lilith>?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, something like that.

[ENDBLOCK]
You're lucky, aren't you? You get to
eat <Lilith>'s home cooking every day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>'s a really good
cook, isn't she?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet a lotta guys have their

[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I got it! I know just the ticket!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here, <Stahn>, you can have
this cut of Bargain Beef!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can? Well, okay,
thanks...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell <Lilith> that I
gave it to you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah! Got it! Look at 
the size of this fish!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This'll make a great dinner!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe... <Stahn>, you look
like you're having fun.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hey there!
[ENDBLOCK]
First you come home out of
nowhere, now you're diving
in the river for fish?
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so silly!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw, come on...
[ENDBLOCK]
I've always
liked you, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's embarrassing to hear you
say that out of the blue. ...Do
you want some fish?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks, but no thanks. That's
the fish we've all been raising
together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the!?
It is!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep. If the others found out you
ate it, they'd be pretty mad. You
should let it go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw man. What am I gonna
have for dinner, then?
[ENDBLOCK]
Here, you can have this. I 
bought too much, anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
L-Luxury Beef!?
I can't take this!
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay, <Stahn>. I'm just
happy to help you!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if you insist...
Thanks a lot!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!

are traveling with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
So that means... <Lilith>'s
with you too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm... <Stahn>? <Lilith>? Can I
talk to you about something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll leave you
guys alone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What'd you want to talk about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-Well... Ever since
<Lilith> left, I've felt
like...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Like there's a hole in
my heart, y'know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I find myself thinking about
you all the time, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Oh, uhm, I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
If <Lilith> disappears too, I...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I become the butt of
everyone's jokes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Listen! If there's no one lower
than me on the totem pole...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then that makes me the
village idiot, now!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big bro, may I borrow
that for a second?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? What do you-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>, you BONEHEAD!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha! <Bacchus> the Bonehead,
I like the sound of that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!
I almost died!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then again, I actually
feel better...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll be patient. I'm
counting on you, big bro.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
To be known as "He who lived
to love" until the day I die...
That is my dream!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
To be known as "He who lived
to love" until the day I die...
That is my dream!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>, what's this
all of a sudden?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I get what you're
sayin', <Bacchus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aha! Someone who
understands me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You got it! I live for
love, too, you see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hello, General <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you come to
see Gramps?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Is
Thomas here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait here a sec.
I'll go get him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, <Lewein>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a long time,
Thomas. I'm glad to
see you're doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, the years are
piling up though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I may ask, where is...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
My wife... passed
some time ago..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... That's truly 
unfortunate. I am
sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You knew Grandma, 
General <Lewein>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, of course
I did. After all...
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's rare to see Thomas
get flustered like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you see, <Stahn>... I was quite
fond of your grandmother back in
the day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woaaah! So you mean, I might
have been the grandson of a
general of Seinegald!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be stupid, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that were the case, you
wouldn't even be here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know about that.
<Stahn> could have very
well been my grandson.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't hate the idea, but
I'm still perfectly happy
with Gramps and <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah, a man's love for his
family!! It's so inspirin'!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm really sorry for attacking
you so suddenly back in the
forest...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought for sure you were
a bandit or something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's no big deal. Forget it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're... forgiving me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not repeating myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You even escorted me
back to the village...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, what were you
doing outside of the village
by yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was looking for the
Legendary Carrot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Legendary... Carrot...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. I heard
that it's somewhere
here in Fitzgald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Forget that, though. What
did you need to do, here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here? I... uh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm looking for the
Softy Kreem stand...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Softy Kreem?
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think we sell anything
like that here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about finding that
stand you're looking for!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Instead, how about we go look for
the Legendary Carrot together?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so strong! It'll really help
me out! Come on, pleeeaase?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. If I change my mind, though,
I'll return to Neustadt on my own.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay! That's fine!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I heard this
from grandpa.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Somewhere in a forest south
of here, there surely rests the
Legendary Carrot of Legend!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see. Well, let's
get moving, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah! Let's go
get that carrot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You even brought me
back home again...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much for coming
with me on my errand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, just tell me one
thing, would you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just what exactly do you intend to
do with that "Legendary Carrot?"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm gonna smack my big bro
upside the head with it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Upside the head?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! I'm VERY
angry at him!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
He just up and left us one
day without saying a word!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if he comes crawling back,
I'm not gonna let him off easy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Well, be careful
not to accidentally
kill him, I guess...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got a real harsh mouth, but
you're actually a really sweet guy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph... Don't say
such dumb things...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm heading
back to Neustadt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, wait...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I never got your name...<x00>
[ENDBLOCK]
