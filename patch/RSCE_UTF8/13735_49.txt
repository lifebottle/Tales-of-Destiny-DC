<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>'s manor？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, sis!
Have you seen my bag?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wha!? <Lion>..!
You're alive!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh...You ok, Sis?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, that means..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maaa! Sis is
acting weird...
[ENDBLOCK]
Kris
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kris
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ma, <Marian>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kris
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a funny girl, for sure.
Anyway, ready to go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Go?? Go where??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh come on, you know
dad finally got some time off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're taking a trip to
the Frostheim Hot Springs!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Trip!? Dad??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kris
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, don't be lazy.
Let's go already!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? I'm part of the family
too, don't ignore me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kris
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh..What's going on??
A-Am I dreaming??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, of course it's
a dream. Ahaha..haha..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're so wierd...
Still, even so, I love you, sis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kris
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you've already become
a wonderful young woman.
We should go shop together!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am so proud of you, <Rutee>.
Don't be in a hurry to marry.
Stay with us...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop! Stooop!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got the kids, and
the nuns from the orphanage!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And <Mary>, <Philia>, <Woodrow>,
<Chelsea>, <Kongman>, <Johnny> too！
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
...ou ok!??
...<Rutee>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right...
I...I also have..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? What am I..?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were staring off into space
like you were asleep, or something.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Were you dreaming?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah. The dream
of a wimp, I guess...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Master
<Hugo>'s residence.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Master
<Hugo>'s residence.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome. The Master
is currently out of town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Why did our Master do
something so horrid..?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
We would leave the mansion,
but there's nowhere else to go...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> just showed up,
I wonder where she went?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome, sir.
What can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
If you don't keep up...
<Marian> will be very upset.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Have a good day.
I wish you the best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm rooting for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>, will you follow in
your father's footsteps?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
A soldier came by, earlier.
Are you on duty again today?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Hugo> sure is busy, huh?
I rarely see him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Our goal is to be a good and
friendly partner to our customers
in our daily business.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldiers keep questioning us...
What do you think is going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to do with the General!
I really didn't know anything about any of this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
If they learn I work for
Oberon, I'm done for...
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't even go outside, I have
to stay inside the mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Most of the lens piled up in the
courtyard of the castle were ours.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Helping out now won't
instantly fix our poor image...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Young Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. Rembrandt? Where is <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your father is on
the second floor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems you've been given
another mission. You've been
quite busy, Young Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop calling me that.
I'm not a child, anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, "Young Master", huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess the little scion
gets a special upbringing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
GYAAAAA!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You talk too much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you OK?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Honored guests,
please do not take offense.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion> tends to keep
others at arm's length.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, you're here. Let's not
stand outside. Come on in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home.
You're back early.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, I'm on my way
to another assignment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? Well,
would you like some tea
before you go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for the offer...
However, I must depart shortly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is hard to say but...
I may not be home for a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand. So, then,
how long will it take?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know.
It could be over quickly,
or take a long time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chin up, Emilio.
Leave here with a smile.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Something bad happened, didn't it?
...It was your father 
again, wasn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What do you mean by..?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since you were little,
whenever you and your father
argued, you would make that face.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
President <Hugo>...your father's name
carries a great deal of weight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Despite this, you are
your own person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, <Marian>, I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Emilio, if things
get too difficult, perhaps
you could change your name back?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
....!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying, <Marian>?
I could never go back
to my old name!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, Emilio, I still
remember the day you
decided to change your name.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
As well as how much you had
suffered up until then..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you did very well...
and furthermore...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, please, don't say any more...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's OK...It seems you've
merely forgotten what
I wanted to accomplish on my own.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will be recognized for
my own deeds, not
just as <Hugo>'s son!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is why...
my name is <Lion> Magnus!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand. That was nobody's
decision, nobody's but your own.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
So again, don't hang
your head like that.
Keep your chin up, Emilio.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
And when it gets to be
too much to keep inside,
go ahead and cry. You'll
surely feel better, afterward.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Absolutely not!
I cannot cry like some kind of..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heheheh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, you have
somewhere to be, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, right.
I should go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please be careful,
and come home safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear I'll be back, <Marian>.
The moment my duty is
completed, I will return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Despite everything, he's
already so grown up...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Time certainly passes
quickly, doesn't it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Emilio.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good to be
home, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm getting ready for dinner.
Please wait a little longer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Marian>, let's have
dinner together, this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I told you, you shouldn't
say things like that to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm only joking.
I'll be in my room.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK. I'll call you
when it's ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright. I'll
be waiting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry to keep
you waiting!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some things I meant to finish this
morning ended up
taking longer than I thought!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not a problem. I wasn't
waiting that long, anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, where to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our first stop is
the item shop.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
