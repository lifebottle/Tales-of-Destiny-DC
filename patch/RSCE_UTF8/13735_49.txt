<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Where am I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is... <Hugo>'s
manor...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, sis! Have you
seen my bag?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wha-!? <Lion>...!
You're alive!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Of course I am.
You all right, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, that means...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maaa! Sis is
acting weird...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
M-<Marian>...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a funny girl, that's for sure.
Anyway, are you ready to get going?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
G-Going? Where!? 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, don't play dumb.
You know Dad finally got
some time off for once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're taking a trip to the
Frostheim Hot Springs!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Trip!? Dad!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
Come now, dear, don't just stand
there! Go get your things so we
can leave!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, are you gonna leave me
behind? I'll be so lonely if you
leave without me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What's going on!?
A-Am I dreaming!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's what this is,
it's a dream! Hahahaha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going on about, you
weirdo? Still, I love you even if
you are weird, sis.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chris
[ENDBLOCK]
You've grown into a fine young
woman already, <Rutee>. Let's go
shopping together sometime!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am so proud of you, <Rutee>.
Don't be in a hurry to marry.
Stay with us...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it! STOP IT!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got the kids, and the
nuns from the orphanage!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And <Mary>, <Philia>, <Woodrow>,
<Chelsea>, <Kongman>, and <Johnny>
too!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
...ou okay!?
...<Rutee>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right...
I... I also have...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? What am I...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were standing here gazing
off into space, like you were
asleep or something.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Were you dreaming
about something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yeah. The dream
of a wimp, I guess...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Master <Hugo>'s residence.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Please be careful, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
This is Master <Hugo>'s residence.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome. The Master is
currently out of town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Why did our Master do
something so horrid...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
We would leave the mansion, but
there's nowhere else to go...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> just showed
up, I wonder where
she's been?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome, sir. What
can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
If you don't keep up...
<Marian> will be very
upset.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Have a good day. I
wish you the best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm rooting for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>, will you follow
in your father's footsteps?
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
A soldier came by earlier. Are
you on duty again today?
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Hugo> sure is busy, huh?
I rarely see him anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Our goal is to be a good and friendly
partner to our customers in our daily
business practices.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldiers keep questioning us...
What do you think is going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to do with the CEO!
I really don't know anything about
any of this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
If they learn I work for
Oberon, I'm done for...
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't even go outside, I have
to stay inside the mansion.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Most of the lens piled up in
the courtyard of the castle
were ours.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Helping out now won't instantly
fix our poor image...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Young Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Rembrandt>? Where is <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your father is on
the second floor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems you've been given another
mission. You've been quite busy,
Young Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop calling me that. I'm
not a child anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, "Young Master," huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess the little scion gets
a special upbringing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
GYAAAAA!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You talk too much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Honored guests, please
do not take offense.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rembrandt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion> tends to keep
others at arm's length.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, you're present. Let's not
stand out here. Come on in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home. You're
back early.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, I'm on my way
to another assignment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? Well, would you
like some tea before you go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for the offer...
However, I must depart
shortly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is hard to say, but...
I may not be home for a
while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand. So then,
how long will it take?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know. It could be
over quickly, or take a
long time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chin up, Emilio.
Leave here with
a smile.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Something bad happened, didn't it?
...It was your father again, wasn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What do you mean by...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since you were little, whenever
you and your father argued, you 
would make that face.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
President <Hugo>... your father's name
carries a great deal of weight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Despite that, you are
still your own person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, <Marian>, I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Emilio, if things get too difficult
for you, perhaps you could change
your name back?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying, <Marian>?
I could never go back to my
old name!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, Emilio, I still remember
the day you made the decision to
change your name.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
As well as how much you had
suffered up until then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you did very well...
and furthermore...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, please, don't
say any more...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's fine... It seems you've merely 
forgotten what I wanted to achieve
on my own.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will be recognized for my own
deeds, not just as <Hugo>'s son!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is why... my name
is <Lion> Magnus!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand. That was nobody's
decision, nobody's but your own.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
So again, don't hang your
head like that. Keep your
chin up, Emilio.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
And if you feel like you can't
bottle it up any longer, then
go ahead and cry. You'll feel
better afterwards.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Absolutely not! I cannot
cry like some kind of...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heheheh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, you have somewhere
to be, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, right.
I should go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please be careful, and
come home safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear I'll be back, <Marian>. The 
moment my duty is completed, I
will return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Despite everything, he's
already so grown up...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Time certainly passes
quickly, doesn't it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Emilio.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good to be
home, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm still preparing dinner.
Please wait a little longer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Marian>, why don't we have 
dinner together this time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
I told you, you shouldn't say
things like that to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was only joking.
I'll be in my room.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay. I'll call you
when it's ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. I'll
be waiting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry to keep
you waiting!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some things I meant to finish
this morning ended up taking
longer than I thought!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not a problem. I wasn't
waiting that long, anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, where to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our first stop is
the item shop.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
