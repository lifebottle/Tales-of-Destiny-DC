<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, it's them again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bring us all the food we can
eat! Money is no object!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah! Once we retake the capital,
the Royal Family will cover it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't fight on
an empty stomach!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our victory is assured,
and that's because...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are Dark, the Dark Wings♪
Awesome mercenaries, yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey guys! Never thought
I'd run into you here in
Phandaria!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, yeah. We were in Aquaveil
a bit ago, but we managed to 
sneak a ride over here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
The chaos going on in this country's
a prime opportunity for some quick
gald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
How awful! You'd really
take advantage of our
country like that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, mercenaries. I have a job
for you. My roof is covered in
snow. Clear it for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Snow removal? Why would
we bother with that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Rooftops are important strategic
locations in urban warfare.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our victory may depend on this.
Being experienced mercenaries,
you're well aware of this, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
I, uh, well, of course I am!
Heh, looks like it's up to us.
<John>, <Millie>, let's go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, excellent. Now I don't have to
clear it myself. Those mercenaries
sure proved useful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa... Did you just
con those guys?
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
You're not staying
the night? Then...
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
...D-Did you find my kitties...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, no, but we are
here to help you look
for them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Really!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
As you can see, I'm
kind of stuck here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, I'm beside myself with
worry about my poor kitties...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know exactly
how you feel.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a sec. We don't even know
where to start looking!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know where
they might be?
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, yes, actually. I heard that some
cats that resembled my babies were
in Tilso forest a little bit ago!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's hurry
to Tilso Forest!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...She dashed off...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go to Tilso
Forest, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah, I forgot to mention.
I have ten cats in total.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wha-?! TEN?! WHAT!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go, <Rutee>.

them one more time?

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, what can I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm looking for a
certain something...
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
I see! Rumor has it that what
you're looking for is deep in
the Tilso Forest to the north.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much!
Well, off I go, then!
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, are you really
going there alone?
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
What about your friends?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please keep this a secret
from everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is something
I have to do alone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
All righty, I reckon I'm off
to Tilso Forest, then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe! Big bro'll
be so surprised!
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
What you're looking for
should be in Tilso Forest.
[ENDBLOCK]
Innkeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe you're
going alone, though...
Please be careful!
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
Give up the search for now?
(Stay at the Inn to try again)
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
All righty, I reckon I'm off
to Tilso Forest, then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe! Big bro'll
be so surprised!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah... Big bro...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>! Where have you
been all by yourself!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You left without a word!
We were so worried!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry... I just wanted
to go for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, let's go
back to the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big bro?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm giving this to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this...
an herb?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... why?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just something I came
across on my walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well here, why don't
you use it, <Lilith>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh, seriously!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're fighting and risking your
life, trying to save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So no, YOU use it!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, fine!
I'll take it, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't just take it! Make
sure you use it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you don't, then even
when you're awake, I'll...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-wait, <Lilith>! I'll use it!
I promise! I swear!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then it's settled.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks again, <Lilith>.
Seriously.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're welcome...
[ENDBLOCK]

At this rate, the city will be

Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
