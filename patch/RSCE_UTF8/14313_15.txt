Um, excuse me, sir...

Do you mean me?

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.
How can I be of assistance?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, just listen
to what I have to say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Frankly speaking, I want to
meet the King of Pandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The way you speak tells me that you
are different from the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps a man who can gain
access to the castle?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What business do you
have with the king?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
That is none of your concern.
All that matters is that you
help me meet with the King.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you won't be honest with me, I can't
help you. Now, if you'll excuse me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be quick! Are you...
able to meet with the King?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes, I can.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? In that case, can you
get me an audience with him?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why do you need
to see him?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Since you were kind enough to
hear me out, I'll tell you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is... my house was
burned down during the riot.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
My entire family, except for my 
very young brother and sister,
were killed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I begged the soldiers in the area to
help. They said they want to, but
I needed to wait my turn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
But... if I have to wait any
longer... my siblings...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Say no more. I will personally
report your circumstances to
His Majesty at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
R-Really?? Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, what's your name?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is... I am simply
someone who loves this
country with all his heart.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much!

I've got for you...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
A merchant who came from
Seinegald told me that shortly
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
after passing over the border,
they spotted a plant that seemed
to be playing tricks on people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
...At least I think they did.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
The vegetation may
have suffered during
the disturbance in the
city two years prior,
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
but there's still something
precious there that nobody
could ever take away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It's quite poetic.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
