<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, are you okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you doing?! It was
your fault the floor caved in!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, are you hurt?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I’m doing just great!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's good... I'm glad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like I should thank 
you for trying to help me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...But I didn't need your help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, we fell from pretty high
up. It doesn't look like 
we can climb up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll just have to wait for <Lion>
and the others to come help us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well anyway, I’m glad nothing
happened to you, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said that already.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know that money is important
to you, but you're a girl, so you
should be more careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What’s with that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know money is important?
What the hell do you know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really need to listen
to this. "You're a girl, so take
care of yourself." really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you're not even joking. 
Why do you have to go and
say things like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well no, it's because... 
we're friends, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Friends... Friends, right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was thinking about it
before, but you really don't
know anything, do you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That’s why you can so
innocently call us friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
My point is that you had a
cushy  upbringing. You and I
are different.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're in completely different
places. Don't lump us together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Completely different
places, huh... I never really
thought about it like that
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Rutee>, why did you
become a lens hunter?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about my work.
It doesn't concern you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have time now, so please tell
me. I've been wondering about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...About what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
About why you’ll do anything,
no matter how crazy, as long 
as money or lens are involved.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You could say it's simple greed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But don't you think
you're more important
than money or lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course not. What 
a useless question.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter how much it is,
that’s wrong, isn’t it? Your
life can’t be replaced.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is why I say you had
a cushy upbringing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I don't jump at the money in
front of me today, I won't be able
to live the life I want tomorrow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you were this kind of person,
you wouldn't be able to say life is
more important than money.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then <Rutee>, is the reason
you're so worried about money
and lens because...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... So it was that kind of thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry for making
you talk about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't even said anything...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, I'm pretty sure
what I said was right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What you said?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That you should cherish
your life, especially if you 
have people waiting for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If anything happened to you,
don't you think those people
would be sad, <Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I can't say anything too
selfish. I've gone and made my
family worry about me, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gh—! Ow ow ow ow...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What’s wrong?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must've hit something 
when we fell. I'm pretty
tough, though, so I'm fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
When we fell, were you
maybe holding me...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You took the fall for me, 
but you've been playing 
dumb this whole time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Idiot! Isn't that way
too excessive?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd consider you a close friend,
<Rutee>. I'd do anything for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, but I'm not gonna
budge on this one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It sure would be swell if 
they came and saved us.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
