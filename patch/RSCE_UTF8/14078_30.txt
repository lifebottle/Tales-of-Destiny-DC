<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, but I almost
never come here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yes. While we're here,
we might as well grab my
favorite instrument.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way... you don't mean
this giant piano do you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep, you've got it. Ok, <Stahn>,
I need you to go lift up that side for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, uh, well, OK!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Jeez, that was too easy.
I was joking, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, where did I put it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That wasn't funny, <Johnny>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha, sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I haven't touched
this piano in a long, long time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there a reason for that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
A long time ago,
my best friend...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No, nevermind. Anyway,
where did I put that instrument..?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's try asking someone
here in the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Yo, <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're..Sakuraba!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Saku..raba..?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Yup. Nice to meetcha.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yeah. Likewise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I take it there's a reason for
your sudden appearance?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected, you haven't even
touched it even after so long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's no concern of yours.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
It still bugs you, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did something happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
...Do you want to know?
It might change how you see <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's ok then,
you don't have to tell me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, you're a real
nice guy. However...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
But I really want
to talk, so I'll talk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...wha?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
It happened back when
<Johnny> and I were 13.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
There was a time when he and
I both liked the same girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
And one time when the
three of us were together...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
That girl said
something like...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
"<Johnny>'s not very
good with the Piano..."
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
It's so funny! That's all
it took to get this guy to
want to master the piano!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get to the point,
why are you here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huhh! I always thought
you were cool headed
and suave, <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't realise you had
such an adorable side!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>. You're kind
hearted by nature, but
I kinda hate you right now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha, thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh that's right.
So you're <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of the
now adorable <Johnny>
who can't play Piano.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You got it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm in a good mood now, so how 
about I play you a little present?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Here's a little something
I came up with recently.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh right, I happened to receive
an instrument in pretty good
condition. You can have it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sakuraba
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I should be going now.
If I have the time, maybe
I'll stop by again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'd be fine if you didn't.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
See ya.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, why'd he have to be the
one to end up with the instrument
we were looking for..?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord's Son
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Brother
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's unusual.
I can't believe you're home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Each island of Aquaveil has its
own lord, and one of them takes
the throne of the Great King.
[ENDBLOCK]
The current Great King is the Lord of
Terazzi. Before that, it was his father...
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad that the Moreau territory
has been liberated. Now you just
have to figure out what to do with
the Terazzi territory.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's too late to say, but your father
was tricked by <Tiberius>.
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't say this out loud, but when
that guy died, my stomach dropped.
[ENDBLOCK]
There is a widespread rumor
that Seinegald is to blame for
this incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't expect this to happen
just when we were showing
signs of friendship...
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't bother your fellow foreigners
The Shiden family's shame will be
transmitted to foreign countries.
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please take care
of <Johnny>. No need to spoil him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, please take
care of the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> is my youngest brother,
and I still think he's cute.

[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please take
care of my brother.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
