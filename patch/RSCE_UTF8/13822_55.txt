<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? No! The Eye of Atamoni
should be here!?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're too late..?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is where it used
to be? It's that big!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, what are
you looking at?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This statue is really
well-made, impressive.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh I see... THIS is
what they call true art.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks totally real right?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
They really captured her fear 
and despair, right!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Phi-<Philia>! How did
you end up like this?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh!? It's a real person!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Use a Panacea Bottle. 
It'll return her to normal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bishop <Ayles>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's ok <Philia>,
you're safe now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bishop... I'm so,
so sorry!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I...! I let the
unthinkable happen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Calm down child...
What happened here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Um...well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
They were sent by the king, 
It's ok. Go on...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I went to the sanctuary
with the high priest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then... as ordered...
I unsealed this room.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
It should be impossible to
break the seal unless you're
a very skilled scholar.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
To think that <Philia>'s extensive 
knowledge would doom us so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you came here, was
there anything on the pedestal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, it was something that looked
like a giant lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
And the High Priest ordered 
<Batista> to carry it out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
A giant lens, huh!?
Did I hear that right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be cynical,
it's not the time for that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bishop, what in the world
was that thing...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehhh, seriously?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The cause of the Aeth'er Wars,
THAT Eye of Atamoni?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Aeth'er Wars?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why was it here?  Was it really
the real Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, get back to the point.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-yes. Alright...
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>... Are you saying you
refuse to come with me?
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Such a shame. Guess I'll 
turn you to stone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
As soon as the High Priest
touched it ...it began to glow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
And then monsters appeared...! 
I...  Because of that I became...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't push yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know where
<Greybum> took it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Perhaps.
He's going to Calvalese?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before I turned to stone, 
I overheard him say so.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Calvalese...It's possible we
just missed each other then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If he's taking it to Calvalese, 
he'll need a considerably large ship.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Darilsheid Port is the only one
in the area where he can dock
a ship like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Dymlos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can it really summon monsters?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...It certainly could.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So... If that's his intent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
He could end up filling
the whole world with them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't let
that happen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean she's been through a lot,
look at her, she's petrified!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> can't do as he likes with 
the Eye of Atamoni! We have
to capture him!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're right, <Stahn>!
It's the right decision.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's hurry back
to Darilsheid!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman. You're coming with us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need someone who knows
what <Greybum> looks like.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait. <Philia> can't endure
much more than this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No... I'm going
with them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oblivious or not, I was still
complicit with his plans.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must take responsibility
for releasing the seal on
the Eye of Atamoni...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand... <Philia>,
if you insist.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you very much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am <Philia> Felice.
Nice to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Same here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about him.
He's always like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, wait up!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
