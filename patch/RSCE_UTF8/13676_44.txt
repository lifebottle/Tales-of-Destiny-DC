<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, a little bird.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you think it's
building a nest?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right. Every year,
they lay their eggs on our roof.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's wonderful. I'd love
to witness that moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm pretty sure we saw them leave
the nest earlier this year. Feel free to
swing by and check on it later, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, a nest is forming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It used to be one bird,
but today it's two.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
This bird is very rare. The male
builds the nest first in order to
attract a mate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, so they're the
proactive type.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
You're one strange
and funny kid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just like when I stumbled
upon <Dalis>' house.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha-ha-ha. They're
both strange kids.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, <Mary>, that bird
is still a newlywed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying, <Stahn>?
These birds are more than
we expected.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, there's only
one bird today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that her husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's shift
change time, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shift change?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you see that?
There's an egg!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I definitely see two
eggs. They must be twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm pretty excited.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me, too! I hope they'll hatch soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like the eggs hatched.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Even with the world the way it is,
this one made it through.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, weren't there
two eggs?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
The other egg
didn't make it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that at least the remaining
chicks will leave the nest in good
health.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's time for you
to leave the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're leaving
the nest!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
They've successfully
left the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, what about the
birds' parents?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't they go with them?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
They don't join their children.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
The chicks' parents will fly off
and find a place to die together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know why, but I guess once
they've finished raising their chicks,
they have no purpose in this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Even the birds that just left the nest
will share the same fate next year.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Through this cycle, the future
of their lineage is made.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, it's not sad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thoughts connect lives and create 
the future. I wonder if that's what
our role is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something
in the nest.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
