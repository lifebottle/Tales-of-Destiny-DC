[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister...? What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!? Don't startle
me like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's got you
so nervous?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you here to
see the mayor?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Shh, not here. Let's talk
at the orphanage.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Come with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Want me to come, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, tell us what's
going on.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the kids at the orphanage
are going to put on a play, soon...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that got to do
with the mayor?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, I'm getting to that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
You know this already, <Rutee>, but
the mayor and his wife aren't
exactly fond of this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not much of
a secret here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the two of them will
be attending the play.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm hoping that the children's
performance changes their
minds about the orphanage...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
But... I suspect that the
mayor's wife is trying
to sabotage us...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you were going to go
to the mayor about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Mhm. I don't know what
I'd say, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you can't exactly just
waltz in and ask them "Are
you trying to sabotage us?"
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I have a favor
to ask, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you find out what the
mayor's wife is planning?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you and
<Rutee> discussing?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing. Nothing at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I need your help
with something, if you
don't mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I'll be right there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
This will be our
little secret.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for taking care
of this for me, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Hey, wait a sec...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now what do we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, guess we should start by
going to the mayor's house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guess so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shh! Can't you hear voices
from inside the house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're right! I do
hear something...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't make out what
they're saying, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! What's with that stupid
grin on your face?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was just thinking... This
totally makes us spies!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, grow up...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Still, if you were a spy, you'd
be able to hear them, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you hear that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, there are voices
coming from inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't make out what
they're saying, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah... If only we could-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shh! I'm trying to listen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>? You can
understand them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>.
Shut up!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I also need you to
be quiet, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can hear a woman's voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That must be the
mayor's wife.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The play...prepared...
The orphanage...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...will be crushed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is she up to...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I couldn't
make that out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry guys, but I'm gonna need us
to see this through to the end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to protect the orphanage at
all costs. I can't let the mayor's
wife get away with this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. So the mayor's wife
is planning something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, but I don't know
exactly what...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry... If only
I could have...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Come, now. Don't be
so hard on yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
A lot of people will come to the
play. They won't be able to get
away with anything rash.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be there, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. If they try anything
funny, we can stop them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then. The play is tomorrow.
Feel free to rest here overnight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They still haven't started...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry, <Rutee>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. I'm sure the children just
need more time to get ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
By Atamoni, the children
are gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where could they
have gone!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know! However,
they were just here a
short while ago...
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
They couldn't have
gone far.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Is everything all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, the children
are gone...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, dear, how unfortunate!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't give me that! You had
them kidnapped, didn't you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you accuse me!
I'm the mayor's wife!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
What a rude young lady.
You clearly didn't have
a proper upbringing!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yes, I forgot to tell
you, by the way...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
If today's play happened to be a
failure, we'd have no choice but
to cut funding to the orphanage!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't be serious!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
This can't be real!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way! You
can't do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, how forgetful of me. Sorry,
it must have slipped my mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm looking forward
to the play. Ohohoho~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's clearly involved.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Forget it for now. The play's
due to start at any minute.
We have to hurry!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Their costumes aren't
in the orphanage.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
It's possible they're out in
the town still wearing them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Got it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's split up. Between the
four of us, we should be
able to find them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No...No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
They didn't come back in time...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Alas, what a shame!
Ohohoho...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the orphanage
shuts down, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Fear not! Once we knock this eyesore
down, we'll replace it with the most
exquisite art gallery!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't even joke
about that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't matter what you say.
There is no place for you here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all our fault... If only we
weren't playing hide-and-seek...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No! Don't blame yourselves!
It's not your fault at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>, does this mean
we're going to lose our home?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
No! I want to stay
with everyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, what are you saying?
Everything'll be fine!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if there's no orphanage,
you'll get by just fine as long
as you stick together!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, there are some things that
you can't do on your own, but
together you can do anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, we're
a family, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
There, you see? Let's believe in
the sister's words, all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah! All I need's
my family!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Me, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Enough with this pathetic
"happy family" charade!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's Wife
[ENDBLOCK]
I suggest you make
yourselves scarce,
now!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
That's enough, dear.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What are you
saying, honey?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I know this place
upsets you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
In fact, I feel the same. It hurt
us both to see this place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is, we love children.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're really gonna
stand there and lie
like that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not lying. More than anything,
we wanted a child of our own.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
However... The goddess never
saw fit to bless us so...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever I saw a child who was
abandoned like these orphans...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't help but expect them to
be no better than the parents who
left them here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
We have no right
to have a family!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's my fault, however. My fault
for allowing my prejudice to get
so bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
Honey...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not going to bother
you anymore. You are
free to remain here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, dear.
Let's go home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, Mr. Mayor...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me say something. You
said you didn't deserve to
have a family?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if you really believe
that, then maybe we don't
deserve a family, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Despite that... Well, here
we are. Together.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you
trying to say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm saying you can visit
us whenever you want.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
You'd trust us with these
children? Even after what
we tried to do to you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I think we can let that
slide... Under one condition.
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor
[ENDBLOCK]
...One condition?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
You must promise to truly
be a part of our family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
True family forgives each other, no
matter what. You know that, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll all be their
real children. Not
just acting!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
She's my new mom!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, new mom!
Let's go and play!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mayor's wife
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The sisters are at home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you're back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay safe, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay safe!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Miss <Rutee>!
I knew you'd come back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm gonna miss
you, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I promise I won't cry anymore.
I believe in you, Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I promise I won't cry anymore. I'll
work hard, just like Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home,
Miss <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, let's play!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck!
Be careful!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>! Why is
the sky so weird?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, what's wrong
with the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be fine. You don't
have to worry about us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And so, the brave prince and the
princess were married. They lived
together happily, forever after.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The End.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>! Read us
another one!
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope the next one's about
beating up monsters!
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I want another story about
a prince and a princess!
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, that's not fair! We just
heard a story about that!
[ENDBLOCK]
I want a story about a prince and
a princess. Prince and Princess!
Prince and Princess!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, settle down.
No need to fight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whether you're a monster slayer or
a princess, it's time to take a nap.
[ENDBLOCK]
Awwww!
[ENDBLOCK]
Awwww!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Guess she wasn't
kidding, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Never mind,
it's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>What's wrong? Why aren't
you calling out to her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Dymlos>. Is it really a good
idea to bring <Rutee> with us?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Of course it is. Why would you
even ask such a question?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... <Rutee> just looks so
happy with those kids...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Don't let your emotions get the
better of you. Remember how serious
the situation is right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's right. It'd be a shame if
you came all the way here
and left empty-handed, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just what do you think you're doing
here? I said I'd never forgive you if
you came here, didn't I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-yeah, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I guess I'll let this one slide.
You owe me big, though!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, I need to ask you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You need me and <Atwight>
to help you, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How did you guess?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I saw you with <Dymlos>,
I knew something was wrong.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You're quite right. The Eye of Atamoni
was stolen again, by some unknown force.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? <Atwight>,
where are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The shed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Th-The shed!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet <Lion>'s with you, huh?
I swear, that guy's hopeless!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, <Lion>'s missing.
Hopefully nothing bad's
happened to him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No sense in worrying about it.
C'mon, let's go get the Eye back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you want to go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
C'mon, don't be such a downer!
You get to travel with me, again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Doesn't that make you happy?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, yeah, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then it's settled.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go fetch <Atwight>. I should
probably say goodbye to
everyone, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you guys!
Get over here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your big sis is gonna be heading
out for a while. You all look after
each other, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw, again?
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll miss you, big sis!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be back soon. Just be patient!
Also, do what the sisters say.
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, okay...
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back soon! Be careful!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, now that that's done,
I'm ready to leave whenever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Things have gotten serious,
haven't they, <Dymlos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Indeed. We must hurry to 
Seinegald Castle, at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where are the others?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're supposed to meet
up at the fountain.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The fountain. Got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Miss <Rutee>, you're back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Souvenirs! Where are they?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well. You're all
as lively as ever!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. I brought
enough for everyone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurray!
[ENDBLOCK]
Yay!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, hey, mister! Let's play!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! You shouldn't play
with strangers! Big sis
told me so!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
So whatcha here for, mister?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm looking for a young
woman who reported a
monster sighting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! You mean big sis! She went
out with the nuns this morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's too bad. Do you know
when they'll be back?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... I dunno!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
We were there when the
monster was seen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's true! We were going
to the beach!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The beach? You mean
the one north of here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
North? Hey, what's north?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, north! It's like,
uhh... Up in the sky!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you know everything!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Moving on... Did you happen
to notice anything odd?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You bet I did! I saw some big ol'
building on an island across the
water!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
A building...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I saw it too!
It looked super old 
and stuff!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see... I'll need
to look into that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! Mister! You should
play with us, next time!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back soon! Be careful!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
