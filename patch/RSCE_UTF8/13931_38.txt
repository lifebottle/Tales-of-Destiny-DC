If you leave the city and
head north, you'll find
the capital city, Calviola.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
...Why do I gotta explain
this to foreigners?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Baruk> Foundation's office?
I don't know anything about that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald was attacked?
Ha! Serves ya right!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Calvalese was attacked too?
Why would they do that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky has closed up...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I gave my lens too!
I only had one, though...

[ENDBLOCK]
Don't try to talk to me like
we're buddies or somethin'!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky lit up! I'm
scared... Help me...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
How could they
do this to us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
So, I can trust
you guys?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
That <Baruk> guy looks like
someone I used to know...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well, It's probably
just my imagination.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Baruk> Foundation? ...Hmph.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen <Baruk>
lately. Not that I care.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Why should Calvalese be subjected to
the same treatment as foreigners?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't matter if you're a
foreigner. I'm looking forward
to working with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
I want a weapon to defend myself,
but I don't have enough money...
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Baruk> Foundation office?
No idea, and I wouldn't tell ya
if I knew!
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
What is that thing that looks like
an island floating in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
The monsters have been
getting worse lately... Is
it because of the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
At times like this, I want a weapon
just to protect myself, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the weapon shop owner
gave me something for free,
but told me to protect the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Child
[ENDBLOCK]
He didn't have to say
that, though. I'm on it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Seeing ships up close depresses me,
so I always watch them from afar.

get on a boat off this
rock are so lucky...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
As things are, I couldn't go
anywhere without getting
dirty looks from people...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
All I can do is cheer
you on. Good luck!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? This ain't no
place for foreigners!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Where are you? The city of Cherik,
Calvalese's port city, of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Where are you? The city of Cherik,
Calvalese's port city, of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the entrance of Calvalese...
Not like I need to tell you that!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry for being rude
to you earlier. Please
save the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? You don't have a
Battle Records book?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You look strong enough.
Take this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It demonstrates the effective monster
killing technique, "Definite Strike."
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can perform a Definite Strike
by setting [Definite Strike] to "ON"
from the Customize menu in the 
Main menu.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can also view each monster's
Definite Strike in the Monster Book
if Definite Strike is "ON."

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
