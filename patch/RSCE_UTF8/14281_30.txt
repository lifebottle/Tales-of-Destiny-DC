<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The color of your complexion is
worrisome...I suppose that's to be
expected after everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
How about taking a short rest?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you're probably right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't <Lion>!
You look like you're doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph.
You seem like you're living well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am. I have you to thank.
After all you let me go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My life has become very peaceful
living here with <Dalis.>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Speaking of <Dalis>,
where is he now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He recently set out to
the northern guard tower.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's undergoing medical treatment
at the Forstheim hot springs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Little by little his
condition is improving.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good. That's the
most important thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've come all this way.
You should stay for dinner tonight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I make one mean
Beast Meat Poele, you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, you are welcome
to stay the night if it gets late.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no need.
I won't be staying long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a job to do.
I don't have time for a long visit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...that's a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I must be off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be a stranger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure <Dalis> would love
to host you soon.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005><center>You find a love letter in the
gap between the books.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Dear Mr. <Dalis>,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Your secret admirer
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's pretend we didn't see this.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Gently, you put the love
letter back in its place.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There are books filled with

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>The snow-white grass is dying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, take care of yourself.
Make sure you come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey guys. Has <Mary>
been helpful?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm feeling much better.
Those hot springs work wonders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Entrust Cyril to me.
I'll keep the people safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll go to the castle and
discuss an strategy with <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't afford to have the people
of Cyril to continue to live in turmoil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The dragons seem to have been helpful.
I'm sure <Darzen> will be pleased.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, and the rest of you, take care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Woodrow>, be sure to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And <Mary>. I love you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will never forget what
you have done for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that we can be
together again soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This house!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is where I live.
It isn't much, but it's mine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This potted plant...
It reminds me of something...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Snow white grass. It is native to
the Heidelberg Mountains. It has
the most beautiful flowers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
According to floriography, it means...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Precious Memories."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
The two of us...wanted to fill
this home with flowers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You two...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
In this kitchen...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came home early because I
wanted to watch you cook.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He would come home, whispering sweet
nothings into my ear as I cooked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He looked so happy when
he was eating my poelee.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
On cold nights, we would huddle
together in front of the fireplace.
It was like time stood still.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some nights I had the good
fortune of watching him sleep
peacefully through the night...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This house is filled with
treasures from the days I
spent with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's painful... One memory after
another, it's overwhelming...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It won't stop... My chest...
I feel like it's about to burst...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, I love you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, get out of here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, guys.
I lost control for a moment...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, do you remember anything?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I remember everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can I ask you something?
Who is that guy?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's the owner of this dagger.
His name is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Dalis> Vincent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wasn't the guy we met earlier
named Captain <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He is my husband.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Husband!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Husband!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Husband!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Her husband, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> was an idealistic man who
wanted to change this country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Many people longed for the future
of this country as he described it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
A large number of people gathered
under him, and soon they became
the "Cyril Volunteer Army".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My purpose in life was to be
there for him and support him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder how long ago it was.
The city was suddenly besieged
by the royal army.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Royal Army?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean the civil
war two years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> was the leader of the volunteer
army and led everyone in a heroic battle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shoulder to shoulder we fought as one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But in the end, we were outnumbered.
The volunteer army was defeated, and
my comrades were scattered.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How did that happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know the exact reason.
The only thing I can say for sure is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was <Woodrow>'s father,
<King> Isaac.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Back to the story.
What happened next?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I fled with <Dalis> to the great river
to the north, but we were hunted
down by the royal army.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
In a desperate gamble,
<Dalis> tried to save me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...by pushing me off a cliff.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And this shocked you so much
that you lost your memory?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I suppose that is possible...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How could <Dalis>
not recognize <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think that's what happened.
He knew, but pretended not to know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why would he do that...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that this man, <Dalis>, is
deeply involved in this rebellion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does this mean that <Dalis> is
assisting <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't understand...any of it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was it it mistake...coming back?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is no time to dwell on it.
In a case like this, there's only
one thing to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ask him directly for an answer.
It's the fastest way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I agree. As I recall, he said
he was going back to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
His destination is the same as ours.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go after him, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, both of you. With
everyone by my side, I may have
the courage to see this through.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have heard the name
<Dalis> Vincent before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
He advocated for the independence
of Cyril and was the cause of the
uprising two years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If he's so dangerous,
why is he doing as he pleases?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I only knew about his imprisonment.
There's more to this than meets the eye.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go to Heidelberg. Thinking about
it here isn't going to do any good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
...It's a messy situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I know.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani>
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles.
The first is to [Set your title and
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,
and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
