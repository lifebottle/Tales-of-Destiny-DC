<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't look so good...
I guess your tired after everything
that's happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you go get some rest?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I guess.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's <Lion>, isn't it?
How have you been doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. You're the one
who's looking good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. It's all thanks to
you for lettting me go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am now at peace with <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, what's up with that <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dalis has gone out to the
pickup point north of the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been treating myself at the
Frostheim Hot Springs lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Little by little, I'm
feeling better.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see.
I'm glad to hear it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've come all this way. Please
have dinner with us tonight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll do my best to serve
you a beast meat poelee.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, you are welcome
to stay the night if it gets late.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I'm not going to do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a mission, too, and
I don't have much time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, ...... that's too bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, if you'll excuse me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, come again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> says, you are 
always welcome <Lion>.

<TAG_005>Dear Mr. Dalis,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Your secret admirer
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's pretend we didn't see this.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Gently, I put the love

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, take care of yourself.
Make sure you come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey guys. Has <Mary>
been helpful?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm feeling much better, thanks
to the hot spring bath.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take care of Cyril. I'll keep
the people from getting upset.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll go to the castle and
discuss a way out with <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't afford to make the people
of Cyril any more uncomfortable
than they already are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The dragons seem to have been helpful.
I'm sure <Darzen> will be pleased.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, and the rest of you, take care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Woodrow>, be sure to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And <Mary>. I love you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will never forget what
you have done for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back anytime.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This house!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is where I live. There's
nothing here, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This potted plant...... sure......
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Snow white grass. It's a specialty
of the Heidelberg Mountains and
has beautiful flowers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The meaning of flowers is ......
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Precious Memories"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He and I laughed and talked
about how we were going to 
fill... this house with flowers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That guy is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This kitchen...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came home early because I 
wanted to see <Mary> cooking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
While I was cooking, he came 
and whispered kind words to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He looked so good
eating my poelee.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
On cold nights, I spent time
huddled with him in front of
the fireplace.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
There were nights, that I
would just watch him sleep.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This house is filled with
treasures of the days I 
spent with that him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's painful... one thought after
another, overflowing with...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's like a torrent of...
My chest is... bursting with...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, what's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, I love you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, get out of here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, guys.
I'm so distraught.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, do you remember anything?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. I remember everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can I ask you something?
Who is that guy?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's the owner of this sword.
His name is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Dalis> Vincent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
As I recall, the person we
met earlier... was also called
Captain <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is my husband.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Husband!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Husband!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Husband!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your husband said...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> was an idealistic man who
wanted to change this country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Many people dreamed of the future
of this country as he described it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
A large number of people gathered
under him, and soon they became 
the "Cyril Volunteer Army".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My purpose in life was to be
there for him and support him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder how long ago it was.
The city was suddenly besieged
by the royal army.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Royal Army?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean the upheaval
two years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> was the leader of the volunteer
army and led everyone in a brave fight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I stood next to him and wielded
my weapon with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But in the end, we were outnumbered.
The volunteer army was defeated, My 
comrades were scattered.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How did that happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know the exact reason.
The only thing I can say for sure is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was <Woodrow>'s father,
<King> Isaac.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell me your story first.
And then what happened?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I fled with <Dalis> to the great river
to the north, but we were hunted
down by the royal army.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
In a desperate predicament,
<Dalis> tried to save only me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
By pushing me off a cliff.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean you were so shocked
that you lost your memory?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure that was it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did <Dalis> not notice <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not it. I think he knew
and pretended not to know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you doing that ......?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that this man, <Dalis>, is
also deeply involved in this rebellion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does this mean that <Dalis> has
teamed up with <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Should I have come back here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is no time to dwell on it.
In a case like this, there's only
one thing to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can ask him directly for
the answer. It's the fastest way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. As I recall, he said
he was going back to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
His, and our destination, is the same.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll follow you soon, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, ...both of you. I think
those words gave me courage.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> Vincent is his name?
I've heard of him too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
He advocated for the independence
of Cyril and was the cause of the
uprising two years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
If he's so dangerous, 
why did you let him go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was told that he was imprisoned.
I don't know the details, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go to Heidelberg. Thinking about
it here isn't going to do any good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
...It's a messy situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I know.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
