[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It would be a waste of time if 
I went and got one for myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Please let us know if you
need anything else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
If it was <Lion>, he said
he would come out a little.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
When Ms. <Ilene> returns,
I will tell her about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Please let us know if you
need anything else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
If it was up to <Lion>, he said
he would come out a little.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
When Ms. <Ilene> returns,
I will tell her about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Where did the young lady go?
I hope she comes back soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm afraid this house may
be coming to an end.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
If my lady were here, she would
have taken the initiative to 
collect the lenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
And who might you all be...? Oh,
if I'm not mistaken, are you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> Magnus
and his companions?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Is <Ilene> here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems she's already received
information about us.
[ENDBLOCK]
The miss has left on an errand.
But she should return shortly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then allow us to wait here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Certainly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...This <Ilene> person sure is slow.
I'm getting tired of waiting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, where was that
Softy Kreem stand again?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the town plaza.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll pop in over there for a sec.
It's so boring just standing around.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me too. I've never had
Softy Kreem before.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How about you <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll wait here for <Ilene>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess someone has to stay behind,
huh? Then, I'll go and get you one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No need. I don't really
like sweet things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, don't say that. Let's
all eat together, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
But I just said...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well. I guess if you buy it for me,
it's not like I won't eat it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright! Then wait here a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're back! What happened
to <Batista>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's upstairs in the first room. 
<Lion>'s interrogating him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Interrogating...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Ugh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hmph...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hahh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>'s certainly taking a long time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn> and the other aren't
back yet, either...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nobody's come back yet, Young Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal, isn't the 
air kinda warm here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wouldn't know. I'm a sword.
I can't feel the heat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph...right.
Either way, I'm parched.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like me to
make you some tea?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it cold?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, no. The only kind
of tea we have on hand
is the warm kind...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn, that won't do.
I need something cold.
Hey, Chal...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Something cold, huh?
Sounds like some Softy Kreem
is just what you need.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have
any here, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
No, we don't...
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
I you would like, I could hurry down
to the stand and get some for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, there's no need for
you to leave the house for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, it would be a 
problem if <Ilene> came
back and no one was here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, how about this?
When Miss <Ilene> comes back,
I'll let her know you're in town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll wait here in
your place for Miss <Ilene>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That sounds fine. Alright,
I'll be back in a moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
Ok, please take your time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well, I guess we're doing this.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
