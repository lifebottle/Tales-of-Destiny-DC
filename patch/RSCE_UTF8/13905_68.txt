<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<IGNORE>
[ENDBLOCK]
Use your idiot powers to
do something about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, I'm on it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<ITEM_149> should open it, right?

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You pried the door open with the pickaxe.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
It won't open. It seems you'll
need a tool to force it open.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, there you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm sorry for what I said to <Chelsea>.
I'll have to apologize later.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're all sick of me, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! You're driving me crazy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>. Can I tell
you something even
more terrible?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sad at all that <Lion> died.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
In fact, I'm furious.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not like I'm going to
suddenly start calling him
my brother or something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The only family I have are the
little ones at the orphanage
and the sisters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, <Hugo>, neither of them matter.
They mean nothing to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...See? I'm the worst, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not? You think I'm a selfish,
cold-hearted person, don't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think so.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not? I didn't even
cry like you did.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is that not cold-hearted!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>... you don't
have to do this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it, I can't stand how empathetic
you are. I'm not kidding!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's it. Maybe this was
his plan all along?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's actually alive.
He's watching us,
laughing...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And then, eventually, he'll jump out.
And he'll say, "Ha" or "Hmph."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no way he could have survived.
You know that, don't you, <Rutee>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then... what am I supposed to do...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell me, what am I supposed to do!?
What am I supposed to do!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hated that guy so much!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was so cocky and
always so bossy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not to mention we were
only together for a very
short time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So why are you in so much pain?
Why are you so upset?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>, tell me!
What is it all for?
Please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not smart enough. I don't know
what to say in a situation like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, at least.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
At least...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's carry this burden
together. For his sake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
UWAAAAAAAH!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry you had to watch
such a pitiful display.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But thanks to you, I'm
doing a little better.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to stop <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to acknowledge
him as my father, but... He is.
...And it's my responsibility as
his daughter to stop him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it wrong to fight for
this personal vendetta?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it isn't. I think you're
fine doing that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's get back to the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...O-Okay.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>[Rock Rally] is a game in which
