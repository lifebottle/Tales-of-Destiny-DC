Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
My Liege, here's the damage report
on the <Greybum> Rebellion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. I'll look over
it once I am able.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty! I've prepared a list of
potential queen candidates. Please
be sure to read through them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sure I want to...
I mean, I'll be sure to.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
My liege! The military budget for
this year has been drafted, and
is awaiting your approval!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Highness, I have submitted
a proposal regarding the castle
reserves. I hope you will consider it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. I'll keep
that in mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>! I drew a picture
of you and your friends!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? I can't wait to see it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
You already know his father, King
Isaac, passed away during the
<Greybum> Rebellion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
And before that, his mother
succumbed to illness...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow> was very young
when that happened. He locked
himself in his room, refusing to
leave.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
After three straight
days and nights...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
His father forced the door
open and dragged him out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mild-mannered King
Isaac did that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He certainly did. He scolded
him harshly, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
"You have the nation in front of you
and the people behind you!," he said.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What does that mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the king stops walking, the
people will stumble and the
nation will never prosper.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That sounds
really tough...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Being a king means being between
a country and its people!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why when Master Isaac died,
he was able to suppress his anger
and hold back his grief.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He knew he had to escape,
that it was his duty to
Phandaria to survive.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, my liege?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it seems I've got
a lot of work to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such matters are beneath you.
I'd be happy to handle them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That won't do. They asked
me personally for help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It won't take long, why don't
you wait here for me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha.
Go get 'em!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>, can I ask
you a question?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened to
<Woodrow>'s family?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it looks like
you're back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry to keep you
waiting. Let's go.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes my lady! At 
once, my lady!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come now, chop chop!
Get that food cookin'!
[ENDBLOCK]
Maid
[ENDBLOCK]
A-Absolutely, at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm, I think I'm
doing it right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, what are
you doing here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I, uhm, you know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm playing queen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's no way to treat
the castle staff!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're right.
I'm sorry...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Chelsea>. Let's
go back to the inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, did you enjoy
your time as queen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah! It was great!
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_005><center>The book has been moved.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005><center>There is a biography of a once
great ruler titled, "The Man Who
Became a God and His Wife."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this a memory trapped in a lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
That <Hugo>... What
is he thinking?
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
My liege?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
He made me go around the world
unsealing ancient ruins.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
But why?
What was the point?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn it all, I just
don't understand.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>, sir...
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you afraid of him?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me? Afraid of <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a joke!
How laughable!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the one using <Hugo>!
From the very start!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha! Still, <Lion> having tracked
me down is problematic...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll make <Hugo> regret
trying to manipulate me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the power of the Eye of
Atamoni, I will rule over the
world as its king!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>... He was a pawn
from the beginning...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, he was outmatched.
The one pulling the strings
was <Miktran>, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be with you
in a moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem busy. Maybe I
should come back later.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's you, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I got a little
caught up in a matter
I'm investigating.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Forget it. So what were
you looking into?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The facility we sealed the Eye
of Atamoni in at the advice of
the Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, not long after we
defeated <Greybum>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about it, exactly?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's nothing serious, but...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was curious about the guardian
the Swordians placed there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's what you
were looking into.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't been able to find
anything out, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>, do you perhaps
know anything about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know any details, I'm afraid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I recall correctly, my people
would use them for security.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize, I know that
goes without saying...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay. Don't
worry about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
At the least, you've given
me somewhere to start.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry for interrupting
your research. We'll let
you get back to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't give you much of a
welcome, but please make
yourself at home here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... Maybe... I dunno...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hiya, <Lion>! It's sure
been a while!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
How've you been?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Getting by.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you have some business
here at the castle?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not really. I just happened
to be near Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aside from that, what
are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was looking at
this portrait.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whose portrait is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>'s mother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
His... mother, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was wondering how
I should address her.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oooh! You don't get
it either, <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(Wait, me either?)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
So!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's King <Woodrow>'s mother!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah, what should I call her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Auntie, perhaps?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Or maybe Your Majesty?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I know...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mother-in-law!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Teehee!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a long time since you
defeated <Greybum>, hasn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
More importantly, I've heard that
<Woodrow> has taken the throne.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, so you've heard. Prince
<Woodrow> finally made up
his mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, right. I should call him
"King <Woodrow>," now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The country seems more peaceful
now. It's clear his rule is already
having an effect.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess it's because of
<Woodrow>'s humanity.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's not
the only thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since his accession, he's been working
hard to make up for his late father.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He is an honorable man who
never neglects his duties.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, have you spoken
to His Majesty yet?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
If not, you should. He'll be
very happy to see you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty is in his room
at the end of the corridor.

[ENDBLOCK]
Hello, <Lion>.
It's been a while.

<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're looking for His
Majesty, he's in his room.
Please go and see him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>, so long as you
reign, Phandaria will never fall.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Rest assured, I will protect
the castle even at the cost
of my life!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would like to thank you for
keeping King <Woodrow> safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home,
Your Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are keeping a close eye on
the Aeropoleis from here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
We couldn't stop Belcrant.
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
We couldn't stop Belcrant...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Reports of monster attacks
have been frequent, lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fear not, however. We've
repelled each one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Highness, if only your
father could see the great
king you've become...

<Darzen>

Welcome to Heidelberg Castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Please leave the castle to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
My liege!
How is Seinegald...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
What is the world coming to?
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We're currently gathering information
on the locations targeted by Belcrant.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Our land will not survive long
without the sun's light...
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The fate of Phandaria rests
in your hands, Your Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The fate of Phandaria
is in your hands.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Be sure to return safe, <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We look forward
to your return.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>'s grandchild was
a sweetheart. Everyone
loved her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We knew it was inevitable, but
we're sorry to see her leave.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Is Master <Alba> going to be
safe? I'm worried about him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Darzen> has been receiving
mail from Master <Alba>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was relived to hear
he was doing well.

These are the king's
private quarters.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I can't give you much of a welcome,
but please enjoy your time here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't give you much of a welcome,
but please enjoy your time here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hiya, <Lion>! It's sure
been a while!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
The portrait on the wall is
of King <Woodrow>'s mother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Someday, I'll also
be... Hehehe!~
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a long time, everyone.
I'm glad to see you're doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to our castle!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>? I didn't expect
you to be here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I ended up staying here after
helping out with this and that, you
know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been doing back-breaking
work to help King <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Back...breaking?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You know that means
she's been working hard!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahhh... Right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, please accept my
heartfelt congratulations on your
recent accession to the throne.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no need to be so formal. We've
been through so much together, haven't
we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want you to call me <Woodrow>,
as you always have.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no problems with that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
In regards to the Eye of Atamoni.
I can't believe what happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
To think the sealing facility would
be attacked by the Draconis...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Woodrow>, do you have any
details about the attack?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Unfortunately, I'm only as aware
of the situation as you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems we'll need to speak to
the king of Seinegald directly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then let's
get going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be coming with
you, of course!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where King <Woodrow> goes,
<Chelsea> follows!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice to meetcha, kid!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it okay for you to leave the
country even though you just
took the throne?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. I'm leaving
<Darzen> in charge.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
I, <Darzen>, will protect the country
during Your Majesty's absence even
at the cost of my own life.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the joint responsibility
of Seinegald and Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
As one of the parties involved, it
is my personal duty to investigate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, Your Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
My apologies, but there is one
thing I need you to take care
of before you depart.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmm, I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you heard him. If you don't
mind, please wait here for just
a moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow> has a lot of work
to do, doesn't he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's what kings do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, <Mary>, do
you have a minute?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't mind, I suppose...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where are <Mary> and <Chelsea>
going, I wonder?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who knows?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You needed something from me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just gonna come
out and ask it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, are you on King
<Woodrow>'s side?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah. You're worried because I fought
against the Royal Army before...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't worry. We've
put that behind us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
So yes. We're on the same side.
We will never be enemies.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... That's a relief!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What would you have done
if I had said otherwise?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that's obvious.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
In order to protect King <Woodrow>,
I would have immediately pierced
your heart with an arrow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought you were still a child,
but no... You've become such a
fine young woman.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hm? What were you
two discussing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a secret.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right,
it's a secret!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize for keeping you waiting.
Come, let's head out of the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
