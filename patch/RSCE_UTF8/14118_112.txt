Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems there's been an
incident at that house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, there's been a bit
of an incident. One of my
soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, And they've been caught.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong with you?
You don't look so good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmm...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't tell me, <Fayte>. Did
this girl attack a soldier!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
<Sir Fayte>!
I'm not the killer!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> Please believe me too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Surely such a small Kid. I can't
believe she attacked a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But then again...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
Such a girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear <Johnny>, Please help me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't help you if you
don't help me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, wait. can you
give us a moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Forgive me, but I have
to take this girl into custody.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, why don't you ask around
in the Moreau territory?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There might still be people
who know about the case.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident occurred yesterday 
morning. A soldier was attacked 
here in the Moreau territory.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, there have been a
number  of similar incidents
in the past few days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldier who was attacked
had two scratches on him.
[ENDBLOCK]
soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Based on the testimony of the 
attacked soldier and witnesses.
We arrived at that girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I have an
alibi that I saw the girl at
the time of the incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
I think that's why Master Fayte 
gave you all this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story. Would 
you like to hear a synopsis?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the death.
But she was playing with her cat
under the house at that time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The guy that's dressed in
Shiden gear. I'm sure he'll stand
out. Besides he was talking 
to the cat in a big voice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Can he really talk to a cat?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a girl? Yeah, I was
at the store at that time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
He was looking for quite a while, and
when I thought he made up his mind
and started to wrap the product, he
said he wanted something different.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
I remember it well, because I've done 
it so many times.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, I saw a girl causing a
scene in the fish shop at the harbor.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was kind of curious, so I came
straight back to this inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
As soon as I got home, I opened the
sliding door and there was the girl,
who was supposed to be at the port.
Came from near the weapons shop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
No one know of a secret passage 
in this city. It's a mystery.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you find the culprit?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Now please go inside
and brief <Fayte> on
the situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... Well, when you do find
the culprit, please come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to hear
about the case?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm from Shiden Territory. The port
is blocked and I can't leave.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Prince? What 
are you doing here?!
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you guys are okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I met a man from Seinegald
the other day. I was wrong in
thinking they were savages.
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
The best way to learn about
another country is to ask the
people who live there.
[ENDBLOCK]

so powerful...

Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a Terazzi local, but I had
nothing to do with this, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I can say now that <Tiberius> was
too forceful in its approach.
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
That broadcast completely
erased the existence of 
<Tiberius>, didn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that a good or bad thing? As a
person from the Terazzi territory,
it's complicated.
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what the Black
Cross Fleet, the pride of
Moreau, is doing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll have to get my lens out too.

I'll never forget this grudge.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I have always viewed 
Seinegald as an enemy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, that object has 
changed to Terazzi, 
It's not unreasonable,
is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that the head of
a huge company in Seinegald 
as working on this painting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't it possible that its head
is being manipulated by the 
royal family of Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this what happens
when you go soft on things
like Oberon Corporation?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

you take some of my fruit!

[ENDBLOCK]
Until we know the safety
of the royal family, we just
avoid any rash actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear Gino, I am so sorry for not
being able to protect you...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
From now on, I'll support <Fayte>
and bring back the glory of Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> advised me not to make a 
fuss, and to keep a cool head.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Too tell you the truth, I'm overflowing 
with anxiety, but I'll shut up and do
my job.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm willing to go through anything, if 
I can put the world back together.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! It's the guy tha sings well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw when you were 
fluttering and singing.

[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I know you. Your friend is the
young Prince of Shiden, isn't  he?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
He said that the friend with the
flutter style, was the young Prince
of the Shiden territory.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Fayte>, hooray!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that floating in the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Is it really nighttime?
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Prince, you're so cool!
Keep up the good work!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep up the good work!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are we fighting the
Terazzi territory? We are
both a part of Aquaveil.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
