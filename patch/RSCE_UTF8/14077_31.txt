<Johnny>'s Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Where is my youngest son...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
How long do you intend
to keep moping around?
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Johnny>! You're back!
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you've finally made
up your mind!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, and I have 
no intention to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
My father was once the
Emperor of Aquaveil.
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. And that's why you're gonna
get your throne back from that boy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father, the Emperor's throne is
not hereditary to start with.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
And give me a break. The title of Emperor
never suited me in the first place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nonsense! You are the sharpest
amongst your brothers and the
populace trusts you!
[ENDBLOCK]
If you stopped dressing
so ridiculously...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
This conversation is a waste
of time. Let's go, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
Why... Why are 
you like this...?
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you afraid
of, <Johnny>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord of Shiden
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Father
[ENDBLOCK]
What has become of my little boy?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>It's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Master <Johnny>. How unusual
for you to be back home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Master Arthur and his wife 
are very friendly and easy 
to serve.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
"A woman's place is at home," was once
a firmly held belief in this country...
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
This country has changed a lot ever
since Master Arthur came into power.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
The Shiden family has been working
very hard in an effort to break the
current deadlock, barely sleeping or
resting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take good care
of Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
The Lens gathering has been proceeding
without issue, Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Johnny>, everyone. I'll
be praying for your safety.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady of the Lord
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder where <Johnny> went
off to. He's always aimlessly 
wandering about.
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I didn't know you were in
Moreau. No wonder you were 
nowhere to be found.
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know <Johnny> was in
Moreau. No wonder he was 
nowhere to be found.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> has been getting
it together under <Fayte>'s
supervision.
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard the one responsible
for the current situation is
from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>! Is it true you
went to Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
I want Seinegald to take responsibility
for making the world such a mess.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will things really be fine if
we gather enough lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will things really be fine if
we gather enough lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, you're going up to the
Shell aren't you? Please come
back safely.
[ENDBLOCK]
Make sure <Johnny> comes back safely.
[ENDBLOCK]
This may come off as the words of a
doting parent, but my children are a
treasure more precious to me than
this world.

[ENDBLOCK]
Lord of Shiden
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Father
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't just stand there, <Johnny>.
Come, have some tea with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
I am Arthur, ruler of this land. I don't
think I've seen you guys before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Aquaveil was founded by
Count Michel Shiden.
[ENDBLOCK]
The Shiden family is directly
descended from him.
[ENDBLOCK]
I am no longer the Emperor. It is time
for the younger generation to shine.
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought I'd comfortably retire and
entrust everything to the youngsters.
Current circumstances foiled that plan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>, you will serve well as a
representative of our country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> serving as our country's
representative makes me proud
to be his father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Go <Johnny>! Show them what
Shiden men are made of!
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please look forward
to <Johnny>'s Shiden spirit!
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
This estate is the main castle
of the Shiden territory. Make
sure you don't forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Shiden has no fortresses. That
is a tradition passed down from
Count Michel himself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that things are much
more difficult in the countries
across the sea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm worried other countries will take
advantage of this chaos and attack.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
If I am able, I will do anything you
ask of me, Master <Johnny>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Housekeeper
[ENDBLOCK]
Please let me know if there
is anything I can do to help.

<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue

<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will

Something fun may happen.

What's the matter, <Johnny>?

You don't happen to know where I

a lot a long time ago, do you?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not really sure...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Didn't you give it away on a
whim to some kid in town?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, did I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, let's go talk
to the kids around town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry to drag you along
like this, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh it's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what made my dear <Johnny>
turn out like this. Was it always his
destiny?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>'s Mother
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you reckon you becomin' the
way you are is destiny, <Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh Ma, I'm sick of hearing
that. Get over it, won't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>! You shouldn't talk
like that to your mother!
[ENDBLOCK]

All right, we're heading
out. Take care, Ma.

[ENDBLOCK]

money, honey?

<Stahn>

<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good grief, to be treated like
a child at this age in front of
others is so embarrassing...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then <Johnny>, you should
stop acting like one, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've certainly turned
against me today, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying, <Johnny>?
You were awful to her.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>

<Philia>

What's wrong? Didn't you decide
to be nice to your mother?

<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
That mother of mine... She gave
me 100 gald and told me not to
waste it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must beg your pardon.
I didn't mean to act like
a brat.
