[ENDBLOCK]
Hi, it's been a long time!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know what you're talking
about. I think you may have me
confused with someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you dense? Come on, come on,
come on, tell me another story!
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you really a different person?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, sorry about that.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as you've realized your mistake.
Don't worry about it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that much like
the person you had met before?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If he sees you, he'll surely have 
an interesting reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
He seemed to be in a rush, so it 
will be impossible to find him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Then you should find 
somebody who might know him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'll mistake you for him.

such a beautiful young lady.

<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
