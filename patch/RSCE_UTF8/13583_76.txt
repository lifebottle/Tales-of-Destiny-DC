<Chelsea> is all
grown up now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not the spoiled
brat she was back then.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is all

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not the spoiled
brat she was back then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't always
been spoiled!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you don't mind me
saying that, do you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even <Woodrow>,
that's terrible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did something happen
to you before?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually <Stahn>,That's about the
time that <Chelsea> and I met.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
At first, <Chelsea>
hated <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, that's not true!
I've always loved you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, I can't imagine what
<Chelsea> must be like now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Stahn>, You haven't 
been listening, have you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
At the time, Master was visiting
the castle to teach me archery.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't let the young <Chelsea>
stay at home, so I went with
her to the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I was busy teaching <Woodrow>,
so I couldn't help <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, was very upset 
with <Woodrow> about that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, one day, <Chelsea>
jumped on me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was crying
and sniffling.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I said, "Don't make
fun of my family!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't long after that,
that <Woodrow> started to
treat me as a distraction...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
That...was
difficult.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, that's terrible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd be hurt too if
<Lilith> did that to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would never do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw, that's terrible <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahahaha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hello. I'm still grateful
for your help at Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come now, don't
you remember me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I asked you to help <Chelsea>
and <Woodrow>, didn't I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, you're the old man from back then.
I didn't know you lived
here in the mountains.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
The situation in Heidelberg
has calmed down considerably.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the only one
who came back here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> and <Woodrow>
aren't with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow> and <Chelsea> both
stayed behind at Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
You should
go vist them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'd be
happy to see you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure. If I'm ever at
Heidelberg, I'll drop in.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Looks like the canvas hasn't been

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There is a splendid makeup table.
However, the essential cosmetics
are quite few...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, boy? why have
you come to see me again?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, Where have we met?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps <Chelsea> is in
the Hills behind the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks in advance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're tired, you can rest.
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps <Chelsea> is in
the Hills behind the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks in advance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of <Chelsea>
for me, will you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful on your way to Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're tired, you can rest.
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be too hard on yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long way to Janos. Don't
be too hard on yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
The situation has calmed
down a lot. This is how
I was able to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is still at the castle.
You can go and visit if you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is still at the castle.
You can go and visit if you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why <Woodrow>, Did you throw
away your right as king?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm only kidding, hahaha,
take care of <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>. Be carefull, my dear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you all, for your
support of <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If there is anything I can
do to help, let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even an old man like me
can be of use sometimes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!It's nice
to see you again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please come back
and visit us again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, boy. What are
you going to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to go to the capital
city of Seinegald, Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why do you want
to go to Darilsheid?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to become a
knight of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
A knight...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My gramps was a knight too,
a long time ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Growing up, I would always listen
to the stories he told me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You shouldn't base your goals
on such lukewarm thoughts.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why shouldn't
I go for it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who are you
talking to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fufufu...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahem, sorry. <Stahn>,
I hope you are successful
 in entering the service.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
.....
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're heading toward Seinegald,
you'll need to pass through Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Janos is a town along the border
of Phandaria and Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
From here, you wanna
head southwest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll come with you to Janos. 
I was thinking about returning 
to my hometown.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eehh!? <Woodrow>,
you're leaving already?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I received a letter calling me
back home. I can't ignore it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though I wanted to study
under Master Alba a little longer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
How long are you going
to be so indecisive?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurry up and make a decision.
Aren't you going to succeed
your father?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jeez, I could never live up to
your expectations, Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, we'll set out after we've
finished our preparations, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>. Listen to 
what Master <Alba> says.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow> please, make 
sure you come back.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Each moment will seem like
a thousand years while I'm
waiting for your return!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That doesn't add up...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am not a dictionary... But it just means 
that she'll be eagerly awaiting him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, take care, boy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, of course. We'll be fine.
I won't forget your kindness!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
