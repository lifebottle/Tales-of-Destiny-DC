Explanation
Do nothing

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is all
grown up now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not the spoiled
brat she was back then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is all
grown up now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not the spoiled
brat she was back then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was never a spoiled brat!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, is that really so?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not you too, Lord <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did something happen in the past?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, actually. It was back around
the time <Chelsea> and I first met.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She despised him at first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
T-That's not true! I have always
adored Lord <Woodrow>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you'd never be able to tell
with the way she acts now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Stahn>, you're not even
listening to me are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master was visiting the castle at the
time in order to train me in archery.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't just leave little <Chelsea>
home all alone, so I brought her to
the castle with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I was so busy teaching
<Woodrow>, I didn't have any time
for <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She became very upset with
his highness over that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, one day when she had enough,
<Chelsea> threw herself at me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She was bawling with
snot flying everywhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
She said to me, "Don't take
any more of my family away!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't long after that that she
began clinging to <Woodrow>, and
treating ME like a nuisance...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was...heartbreaking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, that's terrible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd be hurt too if
<Lilith> did that to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never done
anything like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's awful, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hello. I'm still grateful
for your help at Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come now, don't
you remember me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I asked you to help <Chelsea>
and <Woodrow>, didn't I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, you're the old man we met.
I didn't know you lived here in
the mountains.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
The situation in Heidelberg has
calmed down considerably.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the only one who
came back here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> and <Woodrow>
aren't with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow> and <Chelsea> both
stayed behind at Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
You should
go visit them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'd be
happy to see you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure. If I'm ever at
Heidelberg, I'll drop in.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005><center>There is a splendid vanity here.
However, there are hardly any cosmetics...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't you, boy.
Come to see me again?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we met somewhere before?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is likely out back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll leave her to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're tired, you can rest.
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is likely out back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll leave her to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of <Chelsea>
for me, will you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful on your way to Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're tired, you can rest.
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't push yourself too hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long way to Janos. Don't
push yourself too hard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Things have calmed considerably,
so I was able to return home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is still at the castle.
You should pay her a visit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is still at the castle.
You should pay her a visit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't <Woodrow>. Given
up the throne already?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hohohoh, I'm only kidding.
Take care of <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>. Be careful, my dear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I leave <Chelsea> in
your care, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If there is anything I can
do to help, let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even an old man like me
can be of use sometimes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! A pleasure
to see you again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, who might you be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please come visit us again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, boy, what
do you plan to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to go to the capital
city of Seinegald, Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why do you want
to go to Darilsheid?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to become a
knight of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
A knight...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My gramps was a knight
too, a long time ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He'd tell me stories growing up,
and I just sorta got the same idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Accomplishing a goal as
half-baked as that won't be easy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll never know unless I try.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who are you speaking to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heheh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahem, sorry. I'll be praying for
your successful enlistment, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're heading toward Seinegald,
you'll need to pass through Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Janos is a town along the border
of Phandaria and Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
From here, you wanna
head southwest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll accompany you to Janos.
I was just thinking about
heading home anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whaaat!? Lord <Woodrow>,
you're leaving already?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I received a letter calling me
back home. I can't ignore it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Though I would have preferred to study
under Master <Alba> a little longer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't drag your
feet like this forever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not make up your mind already
and take the torch from your father?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Honestly, I'm no match for you Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll set out after we've finished
our preparations, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, make sure you
listen to Master <Alba>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>, please
come by again some time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Every second waiting for you to
return will feel like an eternity.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eternity...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am not a dictionary, you know. ...It
means she will be waiting anxiously.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care then, boy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, of course. We'll be fine.
I won't forget your kindness!

Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick
from all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
