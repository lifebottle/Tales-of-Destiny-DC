[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, there's a little bird.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are they trying 
to build a nest?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right. Every year, 
they lay their eggs on the roof
of our house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's wonderful. I'd love
to see that moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm sure you'll see them leave
the nest again this year, so come 
by and check it out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, a nest is forming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It used to be one bird,
but today it's two.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
This bird is very rare. The male
builds the nest first in order
to invite the mate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, so you're the
proactive type.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a funny girl with
funny things to say.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just like when I stumbled
upon <Dalis>' house.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha-ha-ha. They're
both strange kids.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, <Mary>, that bird 
is still a newlywed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you say <Stahn>. We are
still more than those birds
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, there's only
one bird today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that her husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's shift
change time, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Delivery?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, did you see that?
There's an egg!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I did see two eggs,
so they are twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm impressed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I hope they'll hatch soon..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the chicks were born.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
You were born well, even 
though the world is like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, weren't there
two eggs?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
The other egg 
didn't make it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that at least the 
remaining chicks will leave
the nest in good health.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's time for 
you to leave the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're leaving
the nest!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've successfully
left the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, well, where's
the parent bird?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aren't you coming with us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not going
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
After this, the parent birds
disappear together. And
they die together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know why, but I guess 
when you finish raising a child,
your role comes to an end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
But even the child who has just
left the nest will die the same 
way next year.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how the future is made.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, it's not sad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thoughts connect lives and
create the future. I wonder 
if that's what our role is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something
in the nest.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I collected lens too!
I hope they're useful!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck with that!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Come on in.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
That was a great catch.
When you run out of Gels,

[ENDBLOCK]
Come on in.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
No matter what happens, I'll

[ENDBLOCK]
If you want to go to the royal

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I was also surprised that 
only three guys who took 
out that many soldiers...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm even more amazed 
that you caught them.

This village is thriving.

[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Walt> has made the village
safe. I knew we could rely on him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma
[ENDBLOCK]
The people of Seinegald are very
religious people. We even have
the Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
I thought this was a time of peace,

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the town of Harmentz!
It's so depressing it's laughable, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But everything seems so grand...
there are all those big houses and stuff.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of backwoods 
place did you come from?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not backwoods! 
It's Lienea! In Fitzgald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said that with so much
passion!! But I saw it when
we were on the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, well. It's got fresh air
and the people are friendly. 
It's a great town okay??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you admit it, 
it is backwoods!
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
People stopping at this village
on a journey is rare. Are you
looking for someone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to go to <Walt>'s house. 
Do you know where that is?
[ENDBLOCK]
What, are you all
guests of that guy?
[ENDBLOCK]
The biggest house in town.
That's where he lives.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now I'm wondering what kinda
guy this <Walt> is, based on her
whole demeanor just now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp, at any rate, let's head 
to the biggest house in town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> Katrea! You 
are under arrest!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How in the world 
did I get into this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>, this is your doing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard about the way you handle
your business practices. I have a 
duty to the good people of this town.
[ENDBLOCK]
We can handle the arrest of the
thief from here. Thank you for
cooperating with us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, for the matter
of the cash reward...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Walt you bastard! Selling 
me out for a quick buck?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Business practices... Are they
saying you're a criminal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know nothing about that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> is no criminal. I can
guarantee that as her partner.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
The worst she does is threaten
shop owners for raising their
prices when she's exchanging lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that definitely a crime?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
B-but! You usually shouldn't arrest
someone over something like that, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> doesn't even know what
this is about. Aren't you making
some kind of mistake here?
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't allow you to be a
disturbance. Detain her!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Instead of getting all up in
arms, let's talk this out first.
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with this pretentious 
attitude? Know your place!
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's what you want, fine!
Arrest 'em all! Out of the way!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you feel like talking now?
[ENDBLOCK]
You bastard...!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
How pathetic, I can't
watch anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sir <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Move aside. I'll handle this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have no clue what's going on,
yet you act like some kind of hero?
What kind of idiot are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm no idiot!
I'm <Stahn> Aileron!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, that sword he has...
No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chaltier!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chaltier!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
......
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it...
We've run into another Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am <Lion> Magnus,
Hedge Knight of the
Kingdom of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Two Swordians, huh? That's convenient.
I'll be taking them both back with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You just try it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph, I don't mind using force.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've always wanted to try fighting
a fellow Swordian Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! Are you ok!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hang in there, <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tch. Idiots.
Drag these unconscious 
fools back to Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You there.
Give me an update 
on those criminals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sir <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well well, if it isn't
Mr. Hedge Knight, himself!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
My, you certainly hurried
here as fast as your little
legs could carry you, eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Hey...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would run into someone like this...
Right after what <Marian> told me, too...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Remember what's expected of you,
someone of your rank."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You haven't forgotten,
have you, Master <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. Of course not.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young master, please restrain
yourself. You have more important
things to do right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't need you to tell me that,
I know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, please tell me
what the current situation is.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Just a few moments ago, the criminals
came out of the Inn. Our most elite 
troops were waiting and immediately
surrounded them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, doesn't look like we need 
our mighty Hedge Knight after all, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> doesn't seem to know what 
you're talking about. Maybe you've 
got the wrong person?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll be charged with obstruction 
of justice if you don't move aside 
at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, there's no need to get violent!
Let's talk about this, first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll not tolerate that
arrogant attitude of yours!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(So that's <Rutee> Katrea
...and that Swordian too..)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hear a voice...That's definitely <Atwight>.
...Huh? <Dymlos> is here too!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
Is there really another Swordian here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohhh noooo...I've never been fond of him...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...so there are two Swordians..
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. I see our "Elite Troops"
are really earning their gald, today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No, you've got it wrong!
They're just..waiting
for their chance to strike!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, I'm sure they just
need a little time to nap
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, the fact remains that they were all
knocked out by a mere three people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take it from here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you feel like talking, now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you..!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a pathetic display.
I can't watch this anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You go on ahead as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes sir. I'll be off, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> Katrea, huh.
She definitely resembled me..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to admit, I'm relieved...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know what I would have done
if I couldn't bring myself to fight her...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Chal, what's wrong?
You've been silent for a while, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ughhh, you bet I have.
We just fought against <Dymlos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
On top of that,
we beat up his new Master, as well!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea what
I'm going to say
to them after this...
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, do you have a moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And just who
are you supposed to be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can call me <Walt>.
Consider me a...
representative of Harmentz
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enough about me, though.
You're quite strong, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must be, to have bested
the Witch of Greed, <Rutee>
like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you must be a knight
of great renown, but I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't need to know my name.
Your business.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wha?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
State your business with me.
If you have none, then get
out of my sight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! W-Well, you see...
It's just that...I haven't
received the bounty for
those criminals, yet...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. You're the one
who tipped us off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry.
An envoy with your money
will visit you soon enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Oh, I see!
W-Well then, if you will excuse me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Master, what's wrong?
You lost your cool for a moment, there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
For some time, I've been surrounded
by people who only want to butter me up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm completely fed up with it.
You should know this by now, Chal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's certainly how it's been...
Still, for you to treat him so coldly...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, whatever.
Our mission is complete. Let's head
back to Darilsheid.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
