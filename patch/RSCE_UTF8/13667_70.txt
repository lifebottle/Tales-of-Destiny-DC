<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, there's a little bird.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are they trying to
build a nest?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right. Every year, 
they lay their eggs on the roof
of our house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's wonderful. I'd love
to see that moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm sure you'll see them leave
the nest again this year, so come 
by and check it out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, a nest is forming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It used to be one bird,
but today it's two.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
This bird is very rare. The male
builds the nest first in order
to invite the mate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, so you're the
proactive type.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a funny girl with
funny things to say.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just like when I stumbled
upon <Dalis>' house.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha-ha-ha. They're
both strange kids.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, <Mary>,
that bird is
still a newlywed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you say <Stahn>. We are
still more than those birds
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, there's only
one bird today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that her husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's shift
change time, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Delivery?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, did you see that?
There's an egg!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I did see two eggs,
so they are twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was moved
by it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I hope he's
born soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the chicks were born.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
You were born well, even though
the world is like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, weren't there
two eggs?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
The other egg didn't make it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that at least this remaining
chick bird will leave the nest
in the fryer.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's time for you to
leave the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're leaving
the nest!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've successfully
left the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, well, where's
the parent bird?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aren't you coming with us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not going
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
After this, the parent birds
disappear together. And
they die together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know why, but I guess
 when you finish raising a child, that
ends your role.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such as...
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
But even the child who has just
left the nest will die the same way
next year.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how the future
will be made.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, it's not sad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thoughts connect lives and
create the future. I wonder if
that's what our role is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something
in the nest.

The people of Seinegald are a

<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the town of Harmentz!
It's so depressing it's
laughable, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But everything seems so grand...
there are all those big houses
and stuff.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of backwoods place
did you come from?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not backwoods! It's Lienea!
In Fitzgald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said that with so much
passion!! But I saw it when
we were on the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, well. It's got fresh air
and the people are friendly. It's
a great town okay??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you admit it, it is backwoods!
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
People stopping at this village
on a journey is rare. Are you
looking for someone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to go to a guy named Walt's
house. Do you know where that is?
[ENDBLOCK]
What, are you all
guests of that guy?
[ENDBLOCK]
The biggest house in town.
That's where he lives.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now I'm wondering, what kinda
guy this Walt is, based on her
whole demeanor just now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp, at any rate, let's head
towards the biggest house in town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
This is...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> Katrea! You are
under arrest!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How in the world did
I get into this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>, this is your doing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard about the way you handle
your business practices. I have
a duty to the good people
of this town.
[ENDBLOCK]
We can handle the arrest of the
thief from here. Thank you for
cooperating with us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, for the matter
of the cash reward...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Walt you bastard! Selling me
out for a quick buck?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Business practices... Are they
saying you're a criminal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know anything
about that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> is no criminal. I can
guarantee that as her partner.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
The worst she does is threaten
shop owners for raising their
prices when she's exchanging lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that definitely a crime?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
B-but! You usually shouldn't arrest
someone over something
like that, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> doesn't even know what
this is about. Aren't you making
some kind of mistake here?
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't allow you to be a
disturbance. Detain her!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Instead of getting all up in arms,
let's talk this out first.
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with this pretentious attitude?
Know your place!
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's what you want, fine!
Arrest 'em all! Out of the way!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you feel like talking now?
[ENDBLOCK]
You bastard...!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
How pathetic, I
can't watch
anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sir <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Move aside. I'll handle this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have no clue what's going on,
yet you act like some kind of hero?
What kind of idiot are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm no idiot!
I'm <Stahn> Aileron!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, that sword he has...
No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chaltier!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chaltier!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
......
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it...
We've run into another Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am <Lion> Magnus,
Hedge Knight of the
Kingdom of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Two Swordians, huh? That's convenient.
I'll be taking them both back with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You just try it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph, I don't mind using force.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've always wanted to try
fighting a fellow Swordian Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! Are you ok!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hang in there, <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tch. Idiots.
Drag these unconscious fools
back to Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You there.
Give me an update on those criminals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sir <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well well, if it isn't
Mr. Hedge Knight, himself!
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
My, you certainly hurried
here as fast as your little legs
could carry you, eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Hey...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would run into someone like this...
Right after what <Marian> told me, too...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Remember what's expected of you,
someone of your rank."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
You haven't forgotten,
have you, Master <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. Of course not.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young master, please restrain yourself.
You have more important things to do right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't need you to tell me that,
I know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, please tell me
what the current situation is.
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Just a few moments ago, 
the criminals came out of the Inn.
Our most elite troops were waiting and
immediately surrounded them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, doesn't look like we need our
mighty Hedge Knight after all, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> doesn't seem to know
what you're talking about.
Maybe you've got the wrong person?
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll be charged with
obstruction of justice if
you don't move aside at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, there's no need to get violent!
Let's talk about this, first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll not tolerate that
arrogant attitude of yours!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(So that's <Rutee> Katrea
...and that Swordian too..)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hear a voice...That's definitely <Atwight>.
...Huh? <Dymlos> is here too!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
Is there really another Swordian here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohhh noooo...I've never been fond of him...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...so there are two Swordians..
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. I see our "Elite Troops"
are really earning their gald, today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No, you've got it wrong!
They're just..waiting
for their chance to strike!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, I'm sure they just
need a little time to nap
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, the fact remains that they were all
knocked out by a mere three people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take it from here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you feel like talking, now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare you..!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a pathetic display.
I can't watch this anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You go on ahead as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes sir. I'll be off, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> Katrea, huh.
She definitely resembled me..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to admit, I'm relieved...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know what I would have done
if I couldn't bring myself to fight her...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Chal, what's wrong?
You've been silent for a while, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ughhh, you bet I have.
We just fought against <Dymlos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
On top of that,
we beat up his new Master, as well!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea what
I'm going to say
to them after this...
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, do you have a moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And just who
are you supposed to be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can call me <Walt>.
Consider me a...
representative of Harmentz
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enough about me, though.
You're quite strong, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must be, to have bested
the Witch of Greed, <Rutee>
like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you must be a knight
of great renown, but I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't need to know my name.
Your business.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wha?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
State your business with me.
If you have none, then get
out of my sight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! W-Well, you see...
It's just that...I haven't
received the bounty for
those criminals, yet...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. You're the one
who tipped us off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry.
An envoy with your money
will visit you soon enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Oh, I see!
W-Well then, if you will excuse me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Master, what's wrong?
You lost your cool for a moment, there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
For some time, I've been surrounded
by people who only want to butter me up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm completely fed up with it.
You should know this by now, Chal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's certainly how it's been...
Still, for you to treat him so coldly...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, whatever.
Our mission is complete. Let's head
back to Darilsheid.

<TAG_007>「称号の説明」
称号とはキャラクターにセットする事の出来る、
キャラクターパラメータのひとつです。
具体的なセット方法は次の通りです。
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]

ステータスを表示します。
その画面のまま<Square_ani>を押すと、キャラクターの
ステータス表示を切り替える事が出来ます。

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>ステータスの一番上に、「称号」と書かれた
ページがあります。その画面で<Triangle_ani>を押すと、
取得した称号を切り替える事が出来ます。

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>称号の使い道には、二通りあります。
ひとつ目は……
「称号をセットして、街人に話し掛けよう」
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>街人の中には、称号をセットして話し掛ける事で、
あなたに興味を持つ人がいます。街人に何度か
話し掛けた際、不思議な言動をする事があります。
その時は、持っている称号をセットし直してから、
もう一度話し掛けてみましょう。
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>ヒント：街人に話し掛けた際、プレイヤーの
頭の上に「？」が出る事があります。
その時は、街人のセリフと関連しそうな
称号をセットして、再度、話し掛けてみましょう。
何か嬉しい事が起こるかもしれません。
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>使い道のふたつ目は……
「ステータス画面をかっこ良くしよう」
集めた称号の中で、もし気に入ったものがあれば、
セットしてステータス画面をかっこ良く演出しましょう。
