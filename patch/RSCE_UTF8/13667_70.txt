<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, a little bird.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you think it's
building a nest?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right. Every year,
they lay their eggs on our roof.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's wonderful. I'd love
to witness that moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm pretty sure we saw them leave
the nest earlier this year. Feel free to
swing by and check on it later, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, a nest is forming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It used to be one bird,
but today it's two.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
This bird is very rare. The male
builds the nest first in order to
attract a mate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, so they're the
proactive type.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
You're one strange
and funny kid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just like when I stumbled
upon <Dalis>' house.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Ha-ha-ha. They're
both strange kids.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, <Mary>, that bird
is still a newlywed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying, <Stahn>?
These birds are more than
we expected.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, there's only
one bird today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that her husband?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's shift
change time, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shift change?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, do you see that?
There's an egg!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I definitely see two
eggs. They must be twins.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm pretty excited.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me, too! I hope they'll hatch soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like the eggs hatched.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Even with the world the way it
is, this one made it through.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, weren't there
two eggs?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
The other egg
didn't make it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that at least the remaining
chicks will leave the nest in good
health.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's time for you
to leave the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're leaving
the nest!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
They've successfully
left the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, what about the
birds' parents?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't they go with them?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
They don't join their children.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
The chicks' parents will fly off
and find a place to die together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Why?
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know why, but I guess once
they've finished raising their chicks,
they have no purpose in this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Even the birds that just left the nest
will share the same fate next year.
[ENDBLOCK]
Clerk
[ENDBLOCK]
Through this cycle, the future
of their lineage is made.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, it's not sad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thoughts connect lives and create 
the future. I wonder if that's what
our role is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something
in the nest.

I collected lens too!
I hope they're useful!

No matter what happens, I'll

If you want to go to the royal capital

I was also surprised that

[ENDBLOCK]
I'm even more amazed

<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the town of Harmentz!
It's so depressing, it makes you
wanna laugh, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But everything seems so grand...
There are all those big houses
and stuff.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of backwoods, hick
town did you come from?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not in the backwoods!
It's Lienea! In Fitzgald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's in the middle of nowhere!
I saw it when we were on the
Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, well. It's got fresh air
and the people are friendly.
It's a great town, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you admit it.
You are a hick!
[ENDBLOCK]
Village Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It's rare for travelers to
visit this village. Are you
looking for someone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need to get to <Walt>'s house.
Do you know where that is?
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Are you associates of his?
[ENDBLOCK]
The biggest house in the village,
that's the place you want.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I have a pretty good idea
about who this <Walt> guy is, based
on her whole demeanor just now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp, at any rate, let's head
to the biggest house in town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> Katrea! You
are under arrest!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How in the world did
I get into this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>, this is your doing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a warrant out for your arrest.
I'm just being an upstanding citizen.
[ENDBLOCK]
We can handle the arrest of the
thief from here. Thank you for
cooperating with us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, for the matter
of the cash reward...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>, you bastard! Selling
me out for a quick buck!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
A warrant... Are they saying
you're a criminal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know what
he's talking about!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> is no criminal. 
I can guarantee that
as her partner.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
The worst she does is threaten shop
owners for raising their prices when
she's exchanging lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that definitely a crime?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
B-But! You usually don't arrest
someone over something that
minor, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> doesn't seem to know what
you're talking about. Maybe you've
got the wrong person?
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll be charged with obstruction
of justice if you don't move aside
at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, there's no need to get violent!
Let's talk about this, first.
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll not tolerate that arrogant
attitude of yours!
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's what you want,
fine! Arrest 'em all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you feel like talking now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you...!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
What a pathetic display. I 
can't watch this anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sir <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Move aside. I'll handle this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have no clue what's going on,
yet you act like some kind of hero?
What kind of idiot are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm no idiot! I'm
<Stahn> Aileron!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, that sword he
has... No way...!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it... We've run into
another Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am <Lion> Magnus, Hedge
Knight of the Kingdom of
Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Two Swordians, huh? That's convenient.
I'll be taking them both back with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You just try it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph, I don't mind using force.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've always wanted to try fighting
a fellow Swordian Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! Are you okay!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hang in there, <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tch. Idiots. Drag these
unconscious fools back
to Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You there. Give me 
an update on those
criminals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sir <Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well. If it isn't
Mr. Hedge Knight,
himself!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
My, you certainly hurried
here as fast as your little
legs could carry you, eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Hey...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
To think I'd run into someone like this...
Right after what <Marian> told me, too...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>"Remember what's expected of
someone of your rank."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You haven't forgotten, 
have you, Master <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. Of course not.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Young master, please restrain yourself.
You have more important
things to do right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't need you to
tell me that. I know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, please tell me what
the current situation is.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Just a few moments ago, the criminals
came out of the inn. Our most elite
troops were waiting and immediately
surrounded them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, it doesn't look like we need
our mighty Hedge Knight after all, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> doesn't seem to know what
you're talking about. Maybe you've
got the wrong person?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll be charged with obstruction
of justice if you don't move aside
at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, there's no need to get violent!
Let's talk about this, first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll not tolerate that arrogant
attitude of yours!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(So that's <Rutee> Katrea
...and that Swordian too..)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I hear a voice...That's definitely <Atwight>.
...Huh? <Dymlos> is here too!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Is there really another
Swordian here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Ohhh noooo...I've never
been fond of him...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... So there are
two Swordians...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. I see our "elite troops" are
really earning their gald today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No, you've got it wrong!
They're just... waiting for
their chance to strike!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, I'm sure they just
need a little time to nap.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, the fact remains that they
were all knocked out by a mere
three people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take it from here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you feel like talking now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you...!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a pathetic display. I 
can't watch this anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Move aside. I'll handle this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes sir. I'll be off, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee> Katrea, huh. She 
definitely resembled me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to admit, I'm relieved...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know what I would have
done if I couldn't bring myself
to fight her...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Chal, what's wrong? You've
been silent for a while now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Ughhh, you bet I have. We just
fought against <Dymlos>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>On top of that, we beat up
his new Master as well!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I have no idea what I'm going
to say to them after this...
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, do you have a moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
And just who are you
supposed to be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can call me <Walt>. Consider me
a... representative of Harmentz.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Enough about me, though. You're
quite strong, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must be, to have bested the
Greedy Witch, <Rutee> like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you must be a knight
of great renown, but I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't need to know my
name. Your business.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wha?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
State your business with me.
If you have none, then get
out of my sight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah! W-Well, you see... It's just that...
I haven't received the bounty for
those criminals, yet...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. You're the one
who tipped us off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry. An envoy with
your money will visit you 
soon enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Oh, I see! W-Well then,
if you will excuse me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Young Master, what's wrong?
You lost your cool for a moment, there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
For some time, I've been surrounded by
people who only want to butter me up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm completely fed up with
it. You should know this by
now, Chal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's certainly how it's been...
Still, for you to treat him so coldly...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, whatever. Our mission is complete.
Let's head back to Darilsheid.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
