[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while since the last
time I was on the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You almost got yourself killed
the last time you were aboard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you feeling
nostalgic about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so, Mr. <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. This
guy stowed away
on the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was caught napping
and got mistaken for a
spy. Isn't that crazy?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've led a very hectic life, it seems.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You were reckless and got
yourself into serious danger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's okay. After all,
everything worked out
in the end.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, where's <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was a little green in the face
earlier. I think he went inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is he not feeling well?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not good. I'm gonna
go check on him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go with you.

[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, stop...
Stay away...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it! Why is this
happening to me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to keep our
mission a secret. It's
nothing personal, kid.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was just trying
to hitch a ride
to Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, wait!
[ENDBLOCK]
If we weren't carrying
"that", things might
have been different...
[ENDBLOCK]
Who threw that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
You bastard...! You brought
accomplices didn't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No, I didn't!
[ENDBLOCK]
What is that!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Ship Crew
[ENDBLOCK]
A huge swarm of monsters is flying in
from ahead! There's hundreds of them!
[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible! Monsters attacking the
Draconis!? This can't be happening...
[ENDBLOCK]
Your orders, Captain!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Deploy the first battalion!
Don't let them get inside!
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now's my chance...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah-!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can still get away if
I use that escape pod.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
