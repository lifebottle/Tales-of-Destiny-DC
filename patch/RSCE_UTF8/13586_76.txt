<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Alba>!
Didn't <Chelsea>
come back yet?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, she came bursting through
the door not long ago. She's resting
in her room right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come now, there's no
need to be worried now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, come over
here a second.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm, I see, so that's
what happened...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just what got into
her, do you think?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She may act like an adult,
but she's still a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems her nerves were stretched
to their limits and she just sort
of snapped for a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've wondered this for a while but
why exactly does she act like an
adult like that, anyway?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, if she is going to continue
traveling with you, it would be best
if you knew the full story.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Her parents passed away when
she was still very young.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then i took care of her.
But, she blame herself
for her parents death.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is, it was nobody's fault.
The plague took them both.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, the easiest way to
understand the death of her
parents, was to blame herself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
"My parents died because
I am a child", she believed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not because of you,
Master <Alba>. <Chelsea>
is truly a gentle child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, but that's what's so tragic.
A child being unable to be a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
At least, once this is all over
and done with, I'd like for her
to have a normal childhood..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Alba>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will she ever give up on
<Woodrow> and take interest
in boys her own age, I wonder?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Alba>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Say, <Stahn>. D'you happen to
know any boys around her age?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
At this point, doesn't matter
what they look like. Oh, but
they gotta be good with a bow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry. There aren't many
kids back at my village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, I'm glad to see you,
<Chelsea>. Are you feeling better?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please forgive me, <Stahn>.
That was very selfish of me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, don't mention it.
You're still a kid,
after all, <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not, I'm not a kid!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cut it out! Chelsea,
you're still a kid! Got it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is all
grown up now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not the spoiled
brat she was back then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is all

[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
She's not the spoiled
brat she was back then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't always
been spoiled!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you don't mind me
saying that, do you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even <Woodrow>,
that's terrible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did something happen
to you before?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually <Stahn>,That's about the
time that <Chelsea> and I met.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
At first, <Chelsea>
hated <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, that's not true!
I've always loved you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, I can't imagine what
<Chelsea> must be like now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Stahn>, You haven't 
been listening, have you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
At the time, Master was visiting
the castle to teach me archery.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't let the young <Chelsea>
stay at home, so I went with
her to the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I was busy teaching <Woodrow>,
so I couldn't help <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, was very upset 
with <Woodrow> about that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, one day, <Chelsea>
jumped on me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was crying
and sniffling.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I said, "Don't make
fun of my family!"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't long after that,
that <Woodrow> started to
treat me as a distraction...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
That...was
difficult.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>, that's terrible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd be hurt too if
<Lilith> did that to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would never do that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aw, that's terrible <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahahaha...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. Thank you for taking
care of me at Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you forget
about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I asked you to help <Chelsea>
and <Woodrow>, didn't I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, that old man? I didn't know
he lived this deep in the mountains.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
The situation in Heidelberg
has calmed down.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the only one
that came back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aren't <Chelsea> and
<Woodrow> with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
As for <Woodrow>that is,
<Chelsea> is still at Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I you want to, you 
can show your face.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you'll
be pleased.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I'm ever in Heidelberg,
I'll stop by.
[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_005>Looks like the canvas hasn't been

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>There is a splendid makeup table.
However, the essential cosmetics
are quite few...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, boy? why have
you come to see me again?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, Where have we met?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps <Chelsea> is in
the Hills behind the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks in advance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're tired, you can rest.
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps <Chelsea> is in
the Hills behind the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks in advance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of <Chelsea>
for me, will you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful on your way to Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're tired, you can rest.
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be too hard on yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long way to Janos. Don't
be too hard on yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
The situation has calmed
down a lot. This is how
I was able to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is still at the castle.
You can go and visit if you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is still at the castle.
You can go and visit if you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why <Woodrow>, Did you throw
away your right as king?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm only kidding, hahaha,
take care of <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>. Be carefull, my dear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you all, for your
support of <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
If there is anything I can
do to help, let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even an old man like me
can be of use sometimes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!It's nice
to see you again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please come back
and visit us again.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
