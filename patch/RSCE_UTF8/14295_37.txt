<TAG_007>Ohohoh, what a rowdy little boy!
What do you want!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
How come a kid like you gets
to go to the castle so much?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You're pretty cocky for a girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're hopeless, kid. You need
to learn how to talk to a lady.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Why're you pretending to 
be all grown up like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Listen here, boy. I'm an adult.
I'm not a child like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah? Well, grown-ups don't
wear polka dotted underwear!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
C'mon, you even
dress like a kid!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah? If dressing like this makes
me a kid, then you're a kid too!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wasn't the one pretending 
to be a grown-up like you!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-How could I...this kid...Y-You!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Hey, don't cry! Bein'
a kid ain't so bad!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm not crying over anything!
I'll still be dressing like this
for another 20 years!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
So there!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yikes! You sure get mad easy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
And why shouldn't I? You're
the one bothering me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sorry.

Hello! Welcome to Heidelberg,
the heart of Phandaria!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
A flying town, a city in the sky...
It sounds so romantic, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
They said there was
a big thunderstorm
southwest of the city.
Was that Belcrant...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd protect Phandaria
if I were stronger...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hello! All the lens have
already been gathered!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, and all your
friends, we're counting on
you!

Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty! You guys! Please,
accept my highest regards!

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
There's an incredible pile of
lens! Have you seen it, yet?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Aww, the pile of lens is gone...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't prank me...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hard to believe there were
flying cities built thousands of
years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Does this mean we've
lost this "Aeth'er War,"
or whatever?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We didn't give in to <Greybum>, so
we're not gonna give in now!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Your Majesty! I can't believe
you're talking to someone like
me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria is one of the countries
with the most history behind it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Our streets carry an
air of elegance and
tradition, don't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The shadows in the sky are
getting bigger and bigger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Earth was gouged out of
Seinegald the same way...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there nothing left to do
but wait for the end...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Our future depends on you, Your
Majesty. Somehow... some way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Save our future!
Please...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>, I know you'll become a
king to rival even your father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Your Majesty! Thank
you, thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, His Majesty's friends!
Thank you, thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty... Just
what is going on!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
J-Just what is going on...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
That lightning may
hit the city, next...
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder how many trials the
heavens are going to give us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
Our king is this nation's pride.
I wish him good fortune.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
I foresee you all returning
home victorious.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? You don't have a
Battle Records book?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You look strong enough.
Take this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It demonstrates the effective monster
killing technique, "Definite Strike."
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can perform a Definite Strike
by setting [Definite Strike] to "ON"
from the Customize menu in the 
Main menu.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can also view each monster's
Definite Strike in the Monster Book
if Definite Strike is "ON."
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have anything
else to give you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to
say to you now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back when you've
honed your skills more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So this is Heidelberg...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just like when we were
in Terazzi. No sign of life...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's as if the whole
city is in mourning.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Highness. I am glad
you are safe. I'll explain
the situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
...Sorry. You and your friends
need to hide, quickly!
[ENDBLOCK]
Rebels are patrolling the
streets in great numbers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where is <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
At the castle. He has many soldiers
under his command. Far too many
to risk a frontal assault.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then what should we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We shall be utilizing the evacuation
route we used to flee the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Isn't that one of the kingdom's
most classified secrets?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all right. You're
all my friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a large house on the east
side of town. The passageway can
be accessed from inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The city sure is lively now. It's
completely different from the
last time we were here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's because of <Woodrow>'s
accession to the throne,
right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, <Woodrow>'s king, now!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
You didn't know? The news
spread everywhere!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no clue. Then again, 
the most exciting news to
hit Lienea was Uncle Bob
hurting his back...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uncle who...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Enough! We need to meet up with
<Woodrow>. Get moving to the castle.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
