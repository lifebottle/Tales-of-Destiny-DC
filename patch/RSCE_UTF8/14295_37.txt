<TAG_007>You're a tough kid, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
How come you're only a kid and yet, 
you're in a castle and everything!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
And you're cocky for a girl!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
You shouldn't use that kind of
language around a lady, boy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you trying 
to be, a grown-up?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am a grown-up.
I'm not a kid like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't look like a kid at all!
And adults don't wear pumpkin
pants like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I beg your pardon!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Because as you can see~.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
If this outfit makes me a child,
then you're a child too!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I never said I was a grown-up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Why are you such a child?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hey. Don't cry over
something like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I'm not crying! Because I'm
going to be wearing these pants
for the next 20 years!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Boo.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, don't get mad at
me all of a sudden.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the one who
came at me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, sorry.

Hello! Welcome to Heidelberg, 
the heart of Phandaria!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
An aerial city, a city in the sky
It sounds romantic, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
They said there was a big thunderstorm
southwest of the city. Is that Belcrant?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
If I had more power,
I'd protect Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Hello! I've already 
collected your lens!
[ENDBLOCK]

Your Majesty, and all your

When will the morning come?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a mountain of lens. It's amazing.
Have you seen it yet?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The pile of lens is gone.
Too bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't play tricks on me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe that an aerial
city like that was built a 
thousand years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying that we have
lost the Aeth'er Wars?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We did not give in to <Greybum>.
We will not be defeated this
time either.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, Your Majesty! I can't believe
you're talking to someone like me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria is one of the most
historic countries in the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The streets have a certain elegance
and tradition, don't they?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The shadows in the sky are
getting bigger and bigger.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
That's how the ground was
gouged out of Seinegald, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there nothing to do but to
await the end of the world?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Our future depends on you, 
Your Majesty. Please... please...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Protect our future.
Please...!

Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>, I hope that you will become
as great a king as your father.

[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Your Majesty!
Thank you, thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Your Majesty's people!
Thank you, thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty... What the
hell is this all about?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, um, ...what the hell
is this all about?
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe that lightning
will hit the city next.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder how many trials the
heavens are going to give us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty is the pride
of our nation. I wish you 
good fortune.
[ENDBLOCK]
Elder
[ENDBLOCK]
I can see you all returning
home victorious.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have the Battle Record book?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem reliable enough. 
Here, take this with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
This shows the [Definite Strike] 
coordination that is effective 
against the monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can perform a Definite Strike
by setting [Definite Strike] to 
"ON" from the Customize menu
in the Main menu.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can also view each monster's
Definite Strike in the Monster Book
if Definite Strike is [ON].
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to give anymore. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to say to you now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back once you have honed
your skills some more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So this is the city of Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's just like when we were in
Terazzi. There's no sign
of people, it's all very quiet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's as if the whole city
is in mourning.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Highness, you are 
safe and sound. I am 
aware of the situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
...Excuse me. You and your 
friends please hide.
[ENDBLOCK]
The rebels are out patrolling
the streets right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where is <Greybum>?
[ENDBLOCK]
He is at the castle. But he's got
so many men in the city that it is
impossible to get through the front.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then what should we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's use the emergency passageway
we went through the other day when
we fled from the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that the most important
secret in defense?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care.
You are my friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Head for the house on the east
side of town. That's the entrance
to the emergency passageway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a certain liveliness to the
city. My impression is different 
from the last time I was here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't it because of <Woodrow>'s 
accession to the throne?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, <Woodrow>'s a king now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Didn't you know about it? It was
a pretty big announcement.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not at all. The only major incident
I know of is Uncle Bob's hiccup.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's Bob?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurry up and get to the castle.
We must meet up with <Woodrow>.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
