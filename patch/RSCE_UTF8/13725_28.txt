Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been in and out of
the mansion a lot recently.
Do you live there?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen Oberon's CEO
or his butler for a while now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the mansion of Oberon's
CEO. Isn't it magnificent?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't seen Oberon's CEO
or his butler for a while now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The moun... The mountain is gone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean to tell me Oberon's CEO
is the mastermind behind this?
You've got to be kidding me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If Oberon is truly responsible,
then the entire company should
be shut down.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that the secret weapon
being built within the castle uses
a lot of lens?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Whenever I hear the word "lens,"
I can't help but think of the
Oberon Corporation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
The secret lens weapon has nothing
to do with Oberon, does it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone is relying on you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It has not been publicly disclosed
that Master <Lion> is the CEO's son.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Stay vigilant and report any
suspicious individuals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Every time I hear about Master
<Lion>'s activities, I want to brag
about him to someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Hugo> is now an important asset
to our country. I am here to ensure
his safety.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been relieved of my duties to
guard <Hugo>'s mansion. This is a
direct order from my superiors.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, out of habit,
I'm still here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
It was Mr. <Hugo> who was
broadcasting. As soon as
I heard his voice, I knew.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Betraying one's country is a serious
crime. I'll never forgive <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I was ordered to watch over the
estate. As such, I will not leave
this post.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the
mansion, is waiting for
someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think there's anyone
who would come back to this
mansion now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>, who works at the
mansion, is waiting for
someone to come home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
A life free from the influence of
lens. I can't even imagine it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The CEO of Oberon, <Hugo>,
has so many magnificent 
achievements.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
In a former life, before Mr. <Rembrandt>
found me, I was a lens hunter.

Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Good morning!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I may still be an apprentice,
but I am eager to assist.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Ugh. I'm still an apprentice...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you hear the latest gossip?
Apparently, Master <Lion> is in
fact, this mansion's...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm sorry! It's nothing.
Forget I said anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
They won't even let us whisper
in the manor. These rules are
suffocating...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a light falling from
far up in the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Such an amazing light, I've never
seen anything like it before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that the master and butler are
gone, the residence has gone to pot.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure I won't even get paid
for all the work I've done...
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> has returned, but there's
something different about her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian> insisted that I help
take lens to the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome home, Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, I'm pumped up! Let's
hurry to Hayrise Temple!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's "Straylize!" At least
remember the name!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just remembered something.
Wait here a second.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That took too long!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's get moving.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not even gonna apologize for
making us wait for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have a Poison Charm?
You'll need them from here on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Chal. Explain it to them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You can make jewels
with materials via Rerise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Not only can they prevent ailments, 
but they'll also increase your stats,
and some carry other abilities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Also, you can repeatedly Rerise a gem,
thus increasing their effects on your stats.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So materials become gems, and
you can strengthen them, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
See for yourself. Here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I did it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>It's a good idea to
Rerise materials often.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a moment, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I almost forgot to give
you your allowance.
Here, take this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's so polite to his dad.
My family's completely
different...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm home, <Marian>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Emilio.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, are you leaving?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't expect to be long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, I'll have dinner
ready for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I'll be going, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Emilio, wait a moment, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What is it, <Marian>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Emilio, there's something
on my mind, if you don't mind
me telling you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Sure...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
The way you spoke to that
soldier earlier, that wasn't
very appropriate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though you outrank him,
he was still your senior.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
No one will want to follow your
command if you keep that up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... but that's... he was...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was what, exactly?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
You need to remember what's
expected of someone of your
rank.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... understand. I'll
be more careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, as long as you understand,
I'm glad that I told you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Marian>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, that's all. Please
be careful, and come
back safe.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
