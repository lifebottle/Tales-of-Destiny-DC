If you're headed for Tilso Forest,
it's just north of the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the city of Frostheim.
You guys have come at a bad time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome, you're in Frostheim, the
ocean gateway to Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Just when you thought the
rebellion  was over, now there's
a war in heaven and earth...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been horrible.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If it's a lens from this city, I've
already taken it to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Finish the fight. I'm asking you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going out of town by yourself?

[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Monsters don't show mercy
even if  you're dealing with
a single girl, so be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now, we just need to
get the injured to safety.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I wondered what would happen
for a while, but I'm relieved now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
The war in heaven and earth is
...what we have done, you say?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have much in the way of food
reserves. If things continue like this...
[ENDBLOCK]

I heard that they are making
amazing weapons in Seinegald.

Sis, where are you going?
[ENDBLOCK]

Who did this to you?

There's something weird
floating in the sky...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is the sky is filled
with weird stuff?
[ENDBLOCK]
Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if the lens has
fallen off somewhere?
[ENDBLOCK]
Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
You can go up to that thing
in the sky? That's awesome!

[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that there was a rebellion
in the capital. We don't know any
more at the moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though it ended without
incident, our capital city was
brought down by the rebels.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This fact must be taken
seriously by all citizens.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there any way to prevent
an attack from the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This city is also under
threat from monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Can we collect the lens and
do something about it now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
For now, we will wait for
good news and do our best
to defend the city.

<King> Your Majesty... I'm sorry...

Who is that <Greybum> guy? How 
can he so easily control monsters?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't expect Heidelberg
to fall so easily.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
So we decided to create a new world
of the truly talented, the chosen ones.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The plan that was unfulfilled
a  thousand years ago must
now be realized!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There are certainly a lot of soldiers.
And some of them are injured.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's like they were forced to leave
their home and fled with nothing
but their clothes on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, well now! If it isn't the boy
<Woodrow> found a while back!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that you, Master <Alba>?
What are you doing here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll talk more about it later. Can
you help <Woodrow> and <Chelsea>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Together, we escaped Heidelberg
and made our way to this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
We got separated from our pursuers.
They're still in the forest on the way!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's terrible. <Stahn>, let's
get to the rescue now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, <Mary>, I'm sorry to
leave you, but here goes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah... 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, <Stahn>, you can
go with them. I'm fine now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about, <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know very well that <Mary> 
is very good at what she does.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you can help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>. Isn't that what you've
been hoping for in your heart?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Indeed, what <Dalis>
says is not untrue.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... that and this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since I started living
with you, every day has been
a series of happiness for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should do our best to make
this happiness a permanent one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
And we owe you a great
debt of gratitude, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have to give some of that back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to go too... I will
now work with <Stahn>
and others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, are you sure you
want to do this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does it bother you that
I want to come with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way! You're 
more than welcome.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, then it's settled.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even though I'll be off in a foreign
land, my heart is always with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear it, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
My soul is always with you,
through hard times and happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
So let's get going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice to meet you, <Mary>!
Thank you, <Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's hurry down to <Woodrow>.
He's at Heidelberg, wasn't he?

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!

from a distance, once.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
He's a very handsome swordsman,
and I adore him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
He's got such a small body, yet he's
so graceful on the battlefield 
with all those strong men in tow.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
So I've come up with the
perfect title for Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
"The Rose of Seinegald."
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I may be a girl, but if
it was Sir <Lion>, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Mary>, is that you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are...
[ENDBLOCK]
select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>It's been a while.
Let's see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. By the way, <Mary>?
I heard you had lost your memory.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'd forgotten all about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. You're
really funny, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to visit Cyriil next time.
I want to see <Dalis>'s face, again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm looking forward to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
You're still a bit of a jerk,
aren't you, <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
How are things going
with you and <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh!	You are!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Who? I hope it's not
some kind of blur.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are the lady who lived next door
to <Dalis> as a child, and who took
good care of the young <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you remember me well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, okay. A wife like you is just
fine for a hard man like <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope you can get along with
<Dalis> and let your auntie
carry your child soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Ma'am, what about me?
I'm in private now. You can sign later.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm uncomfortable
when you're naked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's ridiculous. There's no 
such thing as a woman like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm here. I'm here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha.
There's no such thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
So I'll sign it later.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you. Why are
you naked ......?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Your people don't say anything?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha.
Who wouldn't want to see
these muscles of mine!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
(Look of fear)...<x00>
