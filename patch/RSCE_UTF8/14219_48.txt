If you're headed for Tilso Forest,
it's just north of the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the city of Frostheim.
You've come at a very bad time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome! You're in Frostheim,
Phandaria's port city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
First there was the rebellion
that just ended, now there's
this Aeth'er War thing...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been horrible.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I've already taken the lens
from this city to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Finish the fight.
I'm begging you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going out of
town by yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Monsters don't care if you're
a bunch of strong men or just
one little girl. Be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now, we just need to
get the injured to safety.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I was worried about what would happen
for a while, but I'm relieved now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
What does "Aeth'er War" even mean?
What did we do to deserve this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have a lot of food
saved up. If this keeps
up, then...

Who did this to them?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The new king's name
is <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
There's something weird
floating in the sky...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is the sky filled
with weird stuff?
[ENDBLOCK]
Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Did I drop a lens
around here?
[ENDBLOCK]
Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
You can go up to that thing
in the sky? That's awesome!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
What? You're going to Tilso Forest
by yourself for your brother?
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
He's one lucky guy. You must
care about him a lot!
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard there was a rebellion
at the capital. That's all I know
right now, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It all worked out in the end, but
the fact remains that our capital
fell to the rebels.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We would do well
to remember that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
How do we stop an
attack from the sky?
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This city is also under
threat from monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Should we gather more lens so
we can do something about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
All we can do now is wait for
your triumph. We'll keep this
city safe!

Take good care of it.

You can perform a Definite Strike
by setting [Definite Strike] to "ON"
from the Customize menu in the

Forgive me... King Isaac...
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Who is that <Greybum> guy? How can
he so easily control monsters?
[ENDBLOCK]
Phandaria Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't expect Heidelberg
to fall so easily.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, we will create a new world.
One where only the chosen are welcome!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
We will now realize our dream that
was foiled a thousand years ago!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There are so many soldiers...
Some of them are hurt, too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Like they were forced to
flee with nothing but the
clothes on their back...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, well now! If it isn't the boy
<Woodrow> found a while back!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that you, Master <Alba>?
What are you doing here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can discuss that later. First,
<Woodrow> and <Chelsea> need help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
We escaped Heidelberg together
and fled here to Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
We were separated during the escape.
They must still be in the forest!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's terrible!! <Stahn>,
we have to hurry and 
save them right away!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess this is goodbye, <Mary>.
I'm sorry to have to leave you
here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yeah... Thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, you can go with them.
Don't worry about me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean, <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know very well that <Mary>
is good at what she does.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know she'll be a
big help to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>. Isn't that what
you've been hoping for
in your heart?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes. What <Dalis> says is true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... You know... I...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since the day we met, My life
has been filled with bliss.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want our life together
to be cut short. So please...
help them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Besides, we owe you a debt
of gratitude, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must repay you
somehow, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then... I'll go. I'll help <Stahn> and
the others protect this world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, are you sure
you want to do this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What, would you rather
I stay behind?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Certainly not! You're more
than welcome to join us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, then it's settled!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
This, I swear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Though our bodies may be a great
distance apart, our hearts remain
as one.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I, too, swear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Through misery and joy,
my soul is bound to you,
forever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's get going!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good to have you again, 
<Mary>! Thank you, <Dalis>!

If so, do you know a knight
by the name of <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
//please don't change the naming convention here.
//using he and him ruins the punchline, which is
//that the chick thinks Leon is a girl. it's a bit opaque
//until the end in the jp, so they/ them is unfortunately
//the only way to maintain the integrity of the joke.

I've only seen their face
from a distance, once.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I utterly adore them.
They're so dreamy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
They have such a petite body, yet they
are so graceful on the battlefield with
all those strong men in tow.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
So I've come up with the
perfect title for <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
"The Rose of Seinegald."
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I may be a girl, but if
it was <Lion>, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, dear, is that you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're...
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>It's been a while.
Who are you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It has, <Mary>. I heard
you lost your memory.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep. Made lots of room in
my head, that's for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. You're
so funny, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wanted to see <Dalis>'s handsome
face again, so I'll be visiting Cyril
sometime soon!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure he's looking
forward to it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You're such a kidder, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
How are things going
with you and <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah! I knew you recognized
me! "Who are you?," indeed!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> told me about you.
He said you looked after
him when he was just a
little brat.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you have quite
the memory...
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the perfect wife for a
hard-headed dolt like <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Keep <Dalis> in line. I want to hold
his child in my arms soon!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm, excuse me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Yes, young miss?
Sorry, no autographs on my down time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Your bare chest is making
me uncomfortable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nonsense! All women
dig my shirtless style!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Not this one...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahaha! You can't be serious!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I... what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can get my
autograph later!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not what I...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, why aren't you
wearing a shirt?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure your companions are
wondering the same thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahaha! Ain't it obvious! I wouldn't
want to deprive anyone a chance to
see these muscles!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
What a weirdo...<x00>
