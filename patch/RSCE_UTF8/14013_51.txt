Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm? Aren't you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You talking about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's right! You're that guy
guy who managed to beat <Lilith>
in the arena right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You talking about me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I-It's you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got some nerve,
talking like I'm not here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, anyway, is there
something you need?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What? W-Well, Uhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith> will be okay.
Please tell us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, I received an interesting
report I was going to tell you about.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
A while back, some pirates
attacked this city, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, when we
fought <Batista>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it seems that one of 
the ships was sunk during
the fighting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's possible that some
treasure had sunk with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure its okay for you
to share this report with us
like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the ship's underwater. It's
not like I can go there myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Lilith>, say thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you very much!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish I was stronger.
I'm kinda useless, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
Armor Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
My weapons are the best.
Have a look around!
[ENDBLOCK]
Armor Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
You have no idea what's going
to happen at a time like this.
You should be well prepared.

Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Fitzgald meat
is delicious!
[ENDBLOCK]
Meat Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not sure how long this city
will survive, but I'll continue
to do business until the end!
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
How about some
freshly picked
fruit?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fruit Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
We still have stock, so
feel free to shop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome. Wanna
buy something?
[ENDBLOCK]
Produce Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that the sun is gone, Our
crop production worries me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
If you hang around here long
enough, you can get leftovers!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I take what I can get here and
eat it with my family back home.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm hungry...
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw a weird ship dock here.
Some priest-looking guy got on board.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
There's hasn't been much
to eat but scraps recently.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, please!
Bring the sun back!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
The Oberon Corporation's presence
in the city has been controversial.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a long-time resident, but I think
it's good for the city to develop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Ms. <Ilene> evacuating the citizens
without worrying about
herself was so admirable...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Has <Ilene> given up
on this city...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald sent a large number
of soldiers to the damaged area.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Yet the government of this
country isn't doing a thing!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
The government doesn't do anything,
even though we don't know if the
city will be attacked again or not!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Rather than waiting for the powers
that be, I was thinking of doing
what I could, myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't much, But I gave
what lens I could.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know why that barbarian,
<Kongman> or whatever, is so
popular.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> took out an armada alone!?
Hmm... maybe I was wrong about him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, are you going somewhere?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, where's <Kongman> going?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, you're the hero of this
city right? Then do your job!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, I was wrong. I'm
sorry for being so selfish.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck in your quest to save
the world! Mighty! Mighty! Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Go get 'em, <Kongman>!
Mighty! Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Those obsessed with material
gains are always lacking in
spiritual fulfillment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
More than ever, this city needs
a branch of Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish we had a temple
in this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
It is at times like this that we
should spread the teachings of
Atamoni to the people of the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this another test that
Atamoni has given us...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni will surely be a guide
on your path ahead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
We're still getting ready for our
next voyage. Come on back later,
okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter what, we're still setting
sail. I'll show you what a man of
the sea can do!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
How about some
freshly caught
fish?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll stay open no
matter what!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? You don't have a
Battle Records book?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
You look strong enough.
Take this.

killing technique, "Definite Strike."
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice

Main menu.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]

Definite Strike in the Monster Book
if Definite Strike is "ON."
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have anything
else to give you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I have nothing to
say to you now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back when you've
honed your skills more.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!

Aah! <Kongman>. Help me, please!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
More than ever, arguments
are breaking out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What kind of arguments?
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
Sheesh, and this place is supposed
to be the best city on the continent?
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
We had no choice, we had
to get somewhere safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
You see! Refugees from Seinegald have
been showing up, one after another.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
At this rate, the town will be so full of
people, we'll be packed like sardines!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
On top of that, all they do is complain
and make noise... I'm utterly sick of it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you! You're the one who
won't stop complaining!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
This town's full enough as it is,
go back to your own country!
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
How uncivilized. People
like you make me sick!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, you might
as well leave!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Talk about the pot calling the
kettle. Get the hell out of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!? It's because of people like
you that this city will never flourish!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
HEY! Cut it out, all of you!
What's come over you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You stay out of this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everybody, calm down! What
would <Ilene> think of this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> took off, didn't she?
She was nothing more than
a mouthy idealist.
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You're wrong. She was
completely deluded.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did you say!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, cut it out. What'll we
do if you lose your cool?
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't kid around. Whatever <Ilene>
claimed to do for this city, there's
nothing to show for it at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true at all! Ms. <Ilene>
taught us lots of things!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Adults, both the rich and the poor,
only care about themselves!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
But we're different.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Some way or another,
we will find a way to change this city!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, everyone! Are you
really going to let the kids leave
you in the dust like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I reckon we can't
say they're wrong!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It's... definitely pathetic to be
called out like this by kids...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. That's right!
We should all work to make
this town the best it can be!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>... Looks like you've pulled
ahead of me in our little wager.
[ENDBLOCK]
