[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So you found the [Foundation Stone]?
Isn't it the perfect spot to hold a
meeting?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I see you've found the [Golden Butterfly].
It's just as gorgeous as the name implies.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You found the [Tricorn]? It
looks imposing at a glance,
but it's actually kinda cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice job finding the [Gloomdrop].
So they only bloom on nights
when the moon's gone...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
That's inspiring.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You found the [Sand Geoduck]?
Sailors used to keep them as
charms.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
They figured if the critters couldn't
dance around on the beach, the seas
might stay calm.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So you found the [Flying Manta].
To think something so big could
fly...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Crazy, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let me share with
you an interesting story...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a building somewhere
near Darilsheid.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
where peddlers
will go to meet.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I hear there are islands
isolated out at sea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
that are home to
some rare insects.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a creature out at sea
with some strange horns,
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
but it's so rare that
it's seldom ever seen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a plant out there unique
enough you'd spot it instantly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
They say it's like a beacon of
hope in a darkened world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It was... on some island somewhere,
but I can't remember which.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard of a creature that's
earned itself some tall tales.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hrm, it was near some beach.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Dymlos>. What is it
that I'm supposed to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You need to regain your strength
for tomorrow and if you can't sleep,
you need to force yourself to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know, I know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>However. I don't know if you'll
be able to understand this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that supposed to mean...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You have to make
that decision yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Don't try to look to me for the answers
that <Johnny> didn't give you.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
My apologies for bothering
you while you're resting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something I'd like
to talk about with you...
Do you mind if I come in?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, come on in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pardon the intrusion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm going to summon
up a little courage.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, I believe that you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...know exactly what to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just now, while you were
talking with me, it clicked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That there is someone who
is always on your mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
...That's your answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The rest... I don't have
to tell you, do I?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you. I'll be
back in a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure this was
the right thing to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Both of them are clumsy 
with their feelings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I don't give them a little
push, they're not going to
make that leap.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I believe you too are
clumsy with your feelings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm all right with that.
I've made my decision.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It feels like I did that without
even giving it a thought.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
//Lit. つくづく、損な役まわりじゃのお。 -> Thoroughly a detrimental part.
Always playing second fiddle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>But as for me...
I think you're a good woman.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, did you just notice that?
It's such an obvious thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You're awake, which is
unusual for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
For sure, on a day like today.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's see, we should probably
get to the Lens Cannon, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
