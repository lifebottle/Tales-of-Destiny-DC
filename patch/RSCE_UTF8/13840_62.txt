<TAG_005>Let's explore the history
of the fascinating substance
known as "Lens."
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>We have long known of the
energies held within Lens, but
were unable to harness them.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>That is until the "Oberon
Corporation" made history.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Shortly after its founding,
it had succeeded in extracting
those ever-elusive energies.

<TAG_005>"So long as even a single of the
seven pillars still stands, the

divided into five nations.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>First, the Kingdom of Seinegald.
It is centered around its capital of
Darilsheid, and is home to the
Straylize Main Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Second, the Kingdom of Phandaria,
cut off from Seinegald by the Heidelberg
range. Its lands are covered in snow.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Next is Fitzgald, a developing
country home to the city of Neustadt.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>To the east is the Aquaveil
Confederation, a group of island nations
that to this day has stonewalled
diplomatic relations.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Finally there is Calvalese, a
volcanic and desert island.

Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> was good at winning people's
hearts and had gained many followers.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
In hindsight, all of this may have
been preparation for a rebellion.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Was <Greybum> acting
in anticipation of this
situation?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
It is no mere mortal's place to
decide who lives and who dies!
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
We must work with Bishop <Ayles>
to return the temple to normal.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
The temple's been physically rebuilt,
yet the scars of the rebellion remain.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea that the wounds of the
rebellion would still be healing...
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
Numerous people have come to
this temple seeking salvation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
We will do our best to
reassure those people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I tried to stand up to
<Greybum>, but his men
beat me unconscious...
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a miracle I still live.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that I think about it, <Batista> did
always seem to be sketchy to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that <Greybum> was being
manipulated by the mastermind
behind this whole mess.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this true...?

Goddess Atamoni,
please help us...

Please bring back the Eye

[ENDBLOCK]
There is a lot of documents in
this temple. You might say, it's

[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
The term "Aeth'er War" was
indeed penned in literature.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I had assumed it was just
a legend, but it's true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that in the last Aeth'er war,
a savior appeared and saved the
Earth from its plight...

[ENDBLOCK]
You're correct. Do you

[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is Frantz. Believe it

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's quite a wonderful
profession.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
If I may ask, what are you
doing here, King <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's good timing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'see, I'm researching the
"Four Secrets of the World."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is said that in the world there are
four spots, locations unconfirmed, known
only as the "Four Secrets of the World"...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah, you know of them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do these Four Secrets of
the World have to do with us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I have reason to believe I've almost
figured out where the first secret is.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
And as soon as I do, would you
mind checking it out for me if
I told you where to go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why do you want
us to do it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Three reasons.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
One, I hate traveling! You guys
seem to like it though.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Two, I'm poor! You guys seem loaded
though, so you should have no issues
funding the trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Three, above all else, I'm curious.
That curiosity is what is necessary
to excel in this field!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... I have my doubts about
that third one, somehow...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Doesn't it sound fun, though?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
My curiosity is getting
the better of me!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, I'll make sure to
investigate the first secret.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
If you have a spare moment
during your journey, please
come and see me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah~ I wonder if there's anyone
out there with a FULL POWER
ROYAL AURA!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I'm still working on
it. Please come back later.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, as a scholar, it is sad
to see my research come to
an end.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy am I glad to see you.
I have good news!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you located the first
of the Four Secrets?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
You got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay then, what info
do you have?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Before I get to that... This
being the first of the Four
Secrets, I will go with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's take a boat from
Darilsheid to start.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course... I would ask
that you foot the bill for
my traveling expenses,
King <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, let us be off, <Stahn>!
Adventure awaits!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
He sure had no problem
asking me to pay for him...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Aren't we near...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
More importantly, Mr. Frantz. Please
tell us about the first of the four
secrets of the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, right! I'll
tell you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
The first of the four secrets of
the world is the [Demon Reef]!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. There were a lot of 
ships lost at sea around
here long ago...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. The cause of
these incidents has
been a mystery.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Turns out, there's a massive dragon,
known as the "Messenger of the Gods,"
living under the sea here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
U-Uh, wait...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's certainly something.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
According to legend, this dragon
appears to the one who holds a
sword to the sky!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
And he will invite you to visit
his heavenly palace, which
now rests on the sea floor!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That sounds like...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If true, this will be
quite the discovery.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, here I go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, I don't think that's
gonna do anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you implying that
my research is wrong!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What makes you think that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the Leviathan and Radisrol!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeaah, we kinda already did
what Frantz explained...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Whuh...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's fill him in...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mh, I see. I wasn't there when you
called the Leviathan, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, Frantz. I shoulda
realized sooner.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
WHOOHOOOO!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Then that's it! My research
was right all along!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that was sorta unfortunate...
but regardless, I'm feeling pretty
optimistic!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll look into the next Secret. Come
back again sometime, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Muwahahhahaha... At last,
the time has come!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What is it, Frantz...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I... have... new... INFORMATION!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
F-Frantz, you're
acting kinda scary.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
You're... riiiight~. But today's story
is Extra SpooOoOOookyyy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I'm sick of the bit. The
next Secret is supposedly a
Forest of Ghosts.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ghosts?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
A certain forest in Aquaveil
is said to be haunted.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And it's one of
the Secrets?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
It's truly a... SPOOKY SECRET!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, I'm counting
on you, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm on it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Who are you guys?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, did he
just say that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
U-Uhm? Frantz seems
a little different...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well! If it isn't <Stahn>
and <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey!! Why are there
two of you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. That's not it at all. This 
is my older twin, Grantz.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice to meetcha.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you two really
look alike.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's true. However, due to
certain circumstances... well...
[ENDBLOCK]
Grantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse the late introduction, but I'm
Frantz's older brother Grantz. I'm
actually a soldier from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, the older brother is a soldier,
the younger a scholar. They're
completely the opposite.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, it's quite mysterious, huh?
Perhaps if I had been born first, I
woulda been the soldier and Grantz
would have been the smart one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, in the end it probably
isn't likely at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, in the end, that possibility's
just the dream of a wimp.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Dream of a wimp, huh?
As meatheaded as ever,
eh big bro?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, anyway, do you have any
new information, Frantz?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I do! The next Secret is in
the Calvalesian Desert.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That hot place again? Do
we really have to go back?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got a good feeling
about this one!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ughh...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
All I know is that there's something
north of Calviola...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I guess we'll start
by going there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
If I get the time, I'll head
there afterwards too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Goodbye~.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Goodbye.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
When they say it in harmony,
it really creeps me out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Like it's gonna summon
a monster or something...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe, good to see you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem oddly
tense, Frantz...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh wait I get it! You've
found the next of the
Four Secrets!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
You got it! The next one's at
an island east of Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, where specifically
on this island is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I'unno! But! I know you gotta go
to an island east of Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, fine. So what's
going to be there?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, in that
spot, one year...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
One year?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's all that was
written in the book!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know if anything is
there... but off you go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha, be back soon!!<x00>
[ENDBLOCK]
