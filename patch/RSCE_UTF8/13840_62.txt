<TAG_005>Let's explore the history
of the fascinating substance
known as "Lens."
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>We have long known of the
energies held within Lens, but
were unable to harness them.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>That is until the "Oberon
Corporation" made history.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Shortly after its founding,
it had succeeded in extracting
those ever-elusive energies.

<TAG_005>Now, Lens energy has made
drastic improvements to our lives,
allowing greater safety and comfort.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>It's not unreasonable to say
that Seinegald owes its great influence
to the might of the "Seven Generals."
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>"So long as even a single
of the seven pillars still stands,
the kingdom shall never fall."

peace of mind, while deterring its foes.

Generals was <Finlay> Doug; a man
undefeated in battle who earned
himself the name <Finlay> the Fierce.

<TAG_005>The world can be broadly
divided into five nations.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>First, the Kingdom of Seinegald.
It is centered around its capital of
Darilsheid, and is home to the
Straylize Main Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Second, the Kingdom of Phandaria,
cut off from Seinegald by the Heidelberg
range. Its lands are covered in snow.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Next is Fitzgald, a developing
country home to the city of Neuestadt.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>To the east is the Aquaveil
Confederation, a group of island nations
that to this day has stonewalled
diplomatic relations.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Finally there is Calvalese, a
volcanic and desert island.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>While it is generally recognized
as its own nation, there are many
who refuse to acknowledge its
statehood due to its history.

[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> was good at winning people's
hearts and had created many followers.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
In hindsight, all of this may have
been preparation for a rebellion.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Was <Greybum> acting in 
anticipation of this situation?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
People should not be allowed to pick and
choose who gets to live and who doesn't.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
We must work with Bishop <Ayles>
to get the temple back to normal.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
Although ostensibly rebuilt,
the scars of the rebellion still remain.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea that the wounds of the
previous rebellion would still be healing...
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
Numerous people have come to
this temple seeking salvation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
We will do our best to
reassure those people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I resisted <Greybum>, but was
beaten to a pulp by his men...
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a wonder I'm still alive.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that I think about it, <Batista> has
always been a very sketchy person.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that <Greybum> was being
manipulated by the mastermind
behind the whole mess.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this true...?

Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Goddess Atamoni,
please help us...

Minister

take care of the Eye of Atamoni.

Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
Please bring back the Eye
of Atamoni. Thank you.

Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
There's many documents in
this temple. In a sense, it is
a temple of human knowledge.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
The term "Aeth'er war" was
indeed found in the literature.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I had assumed it was just
a legend, but it's true.
[ENDBLOCK]
Minister
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that in the last Aeth'er
war, a savior appeared and saved
the earth's plight...
[ENDBLOCK]

For some reason,

Titles are one of the character parameters

The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople

interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.

notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,

Something fun may happen.

to make your status screen look cool!

[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? I'm just <Stahn>.

[ENDBLOCK]
Are you King <Woodrow>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He didn't mean me, huh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're correct.
Do you need me for something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There there, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is Frantz. 
Believe it or not,
I'm an archaeologist.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's quite a wonderful profession.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
If I may ask, what are you
doing here, King <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's good timing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'see, I'm researching the
"Four Secrets of the World".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the world it is said that there are 
four spots, locations unconfirmed, known
only as the "Four Secrets of the World"...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah, you know of them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do these Four Secrets of
the World have to do with us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I have reason to believe I've almost
figured out where the first secret is.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
And as soon as I do, would you
mind checking it out for me if
I told you where to go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why do you want
us to do it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Three reasons.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
One, I hate traveling!
You guys seem to like it though.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Two, I'm poor! You guys seem loaded 
though, so you should have no problems
funding the trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Three, above all else, I'm curious. 
That curiosity is what is necessary
to excel in this field!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm.. I have my doubts about
that third one, somehow...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Doesn't it sound fun, though?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
My curiosity is getting
the better of me!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, I'll make sure to
investigate the first secret.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
If you have a spare moment during
your journey, please come and see me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah~ I wonder if there's anyone out 
there with a FULL POWER ROYAL AURA
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I'm still working on it.
Please come back later.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, as a scholar, it is sad to
see my research come to an end.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy am I glad to see you.
I have good news!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you located the first
of the Four Secrets?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
You got it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ok then, what info
do you have?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Before I get to that... This
being the first of the Four
Secrets, I will go with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's take a boat from
Darilsheid to start.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course... 
I would ask that you foot
the bill for my traveling
expenses, King <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, let us be off, <Stahn>!
Adventure awaits!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
He sure had no problem
asking me to pay for him...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? This area is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
More importantly, Mr. Frantz.
Please tell me about the first
of the four secrets of the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes you're right,
I'll tell you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
The first and foremost of the
four secrets of the world is
the [Demon Reef]!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the area where there's
been many maritime accidents
in the past right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. The cause of those maritime
accidents has been considered a
mystery for a long time...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
In reality, it is said that there is a
giant dragon in these waters, said
to be an angel of God.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, hold on...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's great!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
According to legend, the angel
of God appears when you hold
up your sword.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
And it is said to take us to the Palace
of the Heavenly Dragon, now submerged
at the bottom of the sea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmm, That place...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's true, it's a great
research achievement.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, let's go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know what, I don't
think that's possible...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying...
that my research's a lie?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What makes you think that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's the Leviathan and Radisrol!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What Franz explained,
we've already done it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me explain, Mr. Frantz...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know that... because I was
there when they called the Leviathan...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, Franz.
I wish I had figured it out sooner.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Because you already did it! 
It means My research wasn't wrong!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that was sorta unfortunate... but
regardless, I'm feeling pretty optimistic!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll look into the next Secret.
Come back again sometime, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Muwahahhahaha...
At last, the time has come!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What is it, Frantz..!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I..have...new...INFORMATION!!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
F-Frantz, you're
acting kinda scary.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
You're...riiiight~. But today's
story is Extra SpooOoOOookyyy!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
OK I'm sick of the bit. Truth is, the next
Secret is about a Forest of Ghosts.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ghost?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
A certain forest in Aquaveil
is said to be haunted.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that one of
the Four Secrets?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
It's truly a. . .SPOOKY SECRET!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, I'm counting
on you, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm on it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Who are you guys?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, did he
just say that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
U-Uhm? Frantz seems
a little different...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well! If it isn't
<Stahn> and <Rutee>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey!! Why are there
two of you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. That's not it at all.
This is my older twin, Grantz.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice to meetcha.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you two
really look alike.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's true. However, due to
certain circumstances... well...
[ENDBLOCK]
Grantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse the late introduction, but
I'm Frantz' older brother Grantz.
I'm actually a soldier from Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, the older brother is a soldier,
the younger a scholar. They're
completely the opposite.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, it's quite mysterious, huh?
Perhaps if I had been born first,
I woulda been the soldier and Grantz
would have been the smart one.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, in the end it probably
isn't likely at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, in the end, that possibility's
just the dream of a wimp.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Dream of a wimp, huh?
As meatheaded as ever, eh big bro?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, anyway, do you have
any new information, Frantz?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I do! The next Secret is
in the Calvalese Desert.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That hot place again?
Do we really have to go back?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got a good feeling
about this one!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ughh...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
All I know is that there's
something north of Calviola...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I guess we'll
start by going there.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
If I get the time, I'll head
there afterwards too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Goodbye~.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Goodbye.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
When they say it in harmony,
it really creeps me out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Like it's gonna summon
a monster or something...
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe, good to see you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem oddly
tense, Franz...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh wait I get it! 
You've found the next
of the Four Secrets!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
You got it! The next one's at
an island east of Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, where specifically
on this island is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I'unno! But! I know you gotta go
to an island east of Seinegald!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK, fine. So what's
going to be there?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
You see, in that
spot, one year...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
One year?
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
That's all that was
written in the book!
[ENDBLOCK]
Frantz
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know if anything
is there...but off you go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha, be back soon!!<x00>
[ENDBLOCK]
