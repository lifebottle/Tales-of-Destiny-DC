[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't women climb
them, too?
[ENDBLOCK]

It's because the mountain is in

King <Woodrow>'s also
havin' fun. It's so cute!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what causes men to
act so childish sometimes?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's truly a mystery...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woaah! <Kongman>,
that's big!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahahah! You got that right,
<Stahn>! I'm the Champion,
after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha, even so, <Stahn>'s
is so small and cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well. What about
<Woodrow>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
WOAHH it's HUUUUGE!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
H-How could I have lost...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen one so
big in my entire life!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, that was refreshing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps I should invite
<Darzen> next time...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong? Why
is everyone staring
at me like that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's that same look <Kongman>
was giving before going in...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, n-nope, it's nothing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's nothing at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with them
all of a sudden?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who knows?<x00>
