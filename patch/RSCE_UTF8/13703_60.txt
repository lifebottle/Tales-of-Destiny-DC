The garden is soothing.
It helps me feel relaxed, which means
I can concentrate on security.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all thanks to Master <Lion>
that the Draconis is back.
[ENDBLOCK]

The garden is soothing.

[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we been deceived by
<Lion> and <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>...
Is that the name of the mastermind?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The Lens Cannon is mankind's trump
card. We must protect it at all costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never fully appreciated
the beauty of sunlight...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The castle is amazing, but it
does have some weaknesses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, there's no way in hell that 
this place is going to be breached.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently, the Empress has not been
seen. It seems she is in poor health.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Well, there's no way in hell that 
this place is going to be breached.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> was able to take the Draconis
because we were overconfident in
our security.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Our responsibility is too heavy.
What should we do...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon's CEO <Hugo> broadcasted that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are headed to <Reynolds>' lab,
take the door on the left.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that the barrel of Belcrant's
gun fell into the sea?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Until the Lens Cannon is complete,
I'll protect this place at all costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of the world for me, alright?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, Uncle <Dryden>
played with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The people at the castle
have been on edge lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Why did this war start?
How can we end it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
We shouldn't go out cause it's
dangerous outside the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he would gather all the
lens in the world in this garden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, there's a hole in the sky!
A hole！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the construction site
of the Integrated Lens Cannon
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon nears
completion. It's more important
than ever to continue collecting lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon is complete.
All that's left is to carry out the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Commander <Ritora>, I will never
forget all that you have taught me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please, for Commander <Ritora>'s 
sake, you must take down <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> is not taking
visitors at this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't fret, the best researchers our
country has to offer are at your disposal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, so this is the Lens Cannon.
It's pretty big, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, we have to pierce through the
outer shell, so it has to be large.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems the gathering of lens for
the cannon's energy is doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just imagine how much you'd make
from selling all these lens...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, you don't need to be
obsessed with lens any longer, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know... but seeing this gets
my treasure senses tingling...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess it's the nature of
an ex-lens hunter...？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey kid, long time no see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, it's you！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhhhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's <Walt>, from Harmentz.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, <Walt>!
Umm...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to pretend to remember.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard quite the tales about your
exploits. You've been doing well, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It really isn't that big of a deal.
I'm just trying to do my best.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should do the same and help
where we can. Hey, you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here's all the lens gathered from
Harmentz. Please use them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks!
<Walt>, you're a great guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no, no.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just trying to be a good citizen
by following your example.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it is your conviction that
has allowed me to come this far.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm... can I butt in?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. You had something
to tell us, didn't you <Reynolds>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah... so the amount of lens
gathered so far isn't enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have enough?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we want to maintain the targeted
energy output, we'll need triple
or quadruple what we currently have. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm starting to feel lightheaded...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha!	It's gonna be so bright, ain't it?
I can't wait to see it light up the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's impossible for Seinegald to
produce that much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
And thus, I have a favor to ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you go around the world
and procure the lens that we need?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry to keep
asking for help, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it.
We'll help out with anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks.
That's really kind of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've already requested other countries
to gather the lens in their major cities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Neustadt, Heidelberg, 
Calviola, and Terazzi.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Should we go in that order?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, you can visit them them
in any order you choose.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's settled then. 
Let's head out.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
