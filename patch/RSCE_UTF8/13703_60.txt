The garden is soothing. It helps
me feel relaxed, which lets me
concentrate on security.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks to Master <Lion>, the
Draconis has finally returned.

The garden is soothing. It helps
me feel relaxed, which lets me

[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Have we been deceived
by <Lion> and <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
So the mastermind behind all
this chaos finally has a name...
The Aetherian King, <Miktran>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The Lens Cannon is mankind's trump
card. We must protect it at all costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd never fully appreciated
the beauty of sunlight...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let the magnificence of the
structure fool you. This castle
has great defenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no way in hell anyone
could breach its defenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The Queen hasn't made any
public appearances recently.
Perhaps she has fallen ill.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let the magnificence of the
structure fool you. This castle
has great defenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no way in hell anyone
could breach its defenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please, forgive us
for our failure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We were overconfident in our
ability to defend the Draconis,
which allowed <Lion> to take it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We are fully responsible.
What should we do now...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You're saying that the CEO of
the Oberon Corporation, <Hugo>,
was behind that broadcast?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're headed to <Reynolds>'
lab, take the door on the left.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that Belcrant's firing
mechanism fell into the ocean?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Until the Integrated Lens Cannon
is completed, I shall protect this
place no matter the cost.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We must leave the fate
of the world to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, Uncle <Dryden>
played with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't this garden beautiful?
My father tends to it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone in the castle
seems to be on edge.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
How did the war start and
how do we make it stop?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
They say that it's dangerous
to go outside the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The lens from all over the world will
be gathered here in this garden.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, do you see that?
There's a hole in the sky!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the construction site of
the Integrated Lens Cannon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon is near
completion. It's more important than
ever to continue collecting lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon
is complete. All that's left is
to carry out the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Commander <Ritora>, I will
never forget all that you
have taught me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Please, for Commander <Ritora>'s
sake, you must take down <Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> is not taking
visitors at this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't fret, the best researchers
our country has to offer are at
your disposal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, so this is the Lens Cannon.
It's pretty big, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, we have to pierce through the
Aethersphere, so it has to be large.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems the gathering of lens for
the cannon's energy is going well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just imagine how much you'd make
from selling all these lens...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Rutee>, you don't need to be obsessed
with lens any longer, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know... but seeing this gets
my treasure senses tingling...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess it's the nature
of an ex-lens hunter...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey kid, long time no see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, it's you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhmmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's <Walt>, from Harmentz.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, <Walt>!
Umm...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to pretend
to remember.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard quite the tales about
your exploits. You've been doing
well, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It really isn't that big of a deal.
I'm just trying to do my best.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should do the same and help
where we can. Hey, you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here's all the lens gathered from
Harmentz. Please use them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks! <Walt>, you're a great guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm nothing of the sort.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just trying to be a good citizen
by following your example.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it is your conviction that
has allowed me to come this far.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm... can I butt in?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. You had something
to tell us, didn't you <Reynolds>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah... so the amount of lens
gathered so far isn't enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have enough?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we want to maintain the targeted
energy output, we'll need triple or
quadruple what we currently have.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm starting to feel lightheaded...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha! It's gonna be so bright,
ain't it? I can't wait to see it
light up the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's impossible for Seinegald
to produce that much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
And thus, I have 
a favor to ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you go around the world and
procure the lens that we need?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry to keep asking
for your help, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it. We'll
help out with anything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks. That's really kind of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've already requested other
countries to gather the lens in
their major cities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Neustadt, Heidelberg,
Calviola, and Terazzi.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Should we go in that order?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, you can visit them in
any order you choose.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's settled then.
Let's head out.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice

<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will

Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
