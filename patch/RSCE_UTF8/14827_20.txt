[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying I'm
not good enough?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
Well well, let's see...Hmm,
yes, you look honest enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to
ask me something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, I can't think of
anything in particular.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, in that case let's you and
I seek favor from the Lens, and
see what they have to tell us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ooh, sounds fun!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens' are all over and around us,
but in truth they hold a mysterious power.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
It's very rare, but it's possible for
a lens that has used up all of it's
energy to absorb one's feelings.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Absorb..feelings?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, things like strong
wishes, love, memories.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
It is said that these sorts of
things hold the most energy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
Among these, those who passed from
this world with strong emotions are
the most likely to leave these feelings
in the lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha, I don't get it at all!
Lens sure are mysterious, huh.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
Well well, that sword has a lens in it.
Hmm, I sense a powerful energy is
locked within it. ...But..I also sense
something very strange about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
It could be a cursed sword.
Please be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you dare call
me a cursed sword!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-It's Ok.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
Not because of the sword or anything,
but please be careful if you find
yourself somewhere that someone
who had powerful emotions was.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ok, I'll watch out.
Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
As I am a wandering Lens Diviner,
now would be your best chance
if you happened to want to ask
me something.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Fortuneteller
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have anything
at all in mind now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well actually,
there is one thing...

talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople

and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's

Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
