[ENDBLOCK]
My services are only available to
those who are honest with others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How about me? Do I
look honest enough?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me take a closer look at
you... Yes... you'll do nicely.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
What secrets would you 
like for me to reveal?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... can't think of anything
specific. I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
I see, in that case let's seek
favor from the Lens. We shall
let their wisdom guide us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ooh, sounds fun!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens are all around us and 
hold a mysterious power.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
On rare occurrences, lens, once
drained of their natural energy,
can absorb the feelings of others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Absorb... feelings?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, things like strong
desires, love, and memories.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
These feelings are the strongest
form of human energy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
Those who pass from this
world with strong emotions
in their heart are most likely
to imprint on the lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, I don't get it at all! Lens
sure are mysterious, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
That sword... it's made with lens.
I sense it holds powerful energy.
However, a strange aura is present.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
It could be a cursed sword.
Please be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
How dare she call me
a cursed sword!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'll be okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
Unrelated to the nature of the sword,
be wary if you find yourself in a place
where strong emotions reside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will, thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
As I am a wandering Lens Diviner,
if you seek my wisdom, now would
be your best opportunity.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Diviner
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure there is at least one
thing you seek knowledge on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, actually, there
is one thing...
