I'm here to pray for the repose of
the soul of Archbishop Merton and
the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while.
You look well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're looking for
<Philia>, I believe she's
outside the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
The rumors of your success
have reached even here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia> was also happy to hear
about you from her disciples.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm here to pray for the repose of
the soul of Archbishop Merton and
the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, I know you have a lot
of work to do for the king,
but I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you all for
your hard work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni
is the cause of this...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
To wield the power of a god from
the body of a human is nothing
short of arrogance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni should've
never fallen into the hands of
man.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it was possible, I wish it could
have remained with the Goddess.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!

<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bishop <Ayles>,
I've returned.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, <Philia>.
Did you fulfill the duty
the king assigned you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, but I'm still under obligation
to the king for now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Keep at it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a long time,
Bishop <Ayles>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, Master <Stahn>. Your assistance
was most appreciated back then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you... err... who might you be?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you're <Philia>'s boss, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
At this time, I would like for
you to join <Philia> and I in...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-What are you saying, <Kongman>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Priestess <Philia>, excuse me
for bothering you so soon
after you've returned.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I have need of your assistance
for a small matter. It will only
take a moment, is that okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, it's fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll wait here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I don't think I'll be long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, as I was saying, I would
like you to join us in...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be blunt, it's not possible
for <Philia> to get married.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Wha?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-Well why not!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, please don't get angry.
The reason is, <Philia> is
already married.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
A-Already... m-m-married!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
NOOOOOOOOOOOooooooo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah! <Kongman>'s lights
went out from the shock!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So anyway, who exactly
is <Philia> married to?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Goddess.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Goddess?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for waiting.
Shall we be...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm, what's wrong
with Mr. <Kongman>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing, I was simply telling
him about the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I must be on my way
now, excuse me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm meeting my wife
here shortly, so I'll...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-W-WIIIIFFEE??!?!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Quick, get out while you can!
Run, and don't look back!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yes sir!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Youu... You talked to me like
I'm some kinda demon!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If wantin' to get married is
so evil then what the heck
was that guy talkin' about!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's true that it's an old custom
for us to not marry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
That said, these days the custom
isn't observed as much.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
In my position, I don't push
it onto my subordinates.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Graah! Do you hear me, Atamoni!
I won't lose to the likes of you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm, I feel like I'm missing
something here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no. Just a demon issuing
a challenge to the Goddess.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't ask this of just anyone...
I wonder if there's someone
who's ready to hear this yet...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, <Philia>. I have a request...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, it's a request to the king,
about the Eye of Atamoni. I would
like you to arrange for it to be
enshrined at this temple again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I... Th-That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the king hears it from you,
<Philia>, I am sure that he will
take the request seriously.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-Well, the truth is... there's
something you need to know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's truly a horrible thing,
but... The Eye of Atamoni
has been stolen again...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...! Aah, it can't be!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
But wait, why did you feel it necessary
to have something so dangerous
returned to the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Surely there's no need...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>... Please listen carefully.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Straylize Temple was created solely
to hide the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That... That's impossible!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, you may be right.
That's only a rumor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, the more rumors like this
spread, the more important the Eye
of Atamoni becomes to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
But that's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
And supposing it's true,
that Atamoni doesn't exist,
that our true purpose is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Absolutely not! I
don't believe that
for an instant!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whether Atamoni
exists or not...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The important thing is that
the Goddess lives on within
everyone's hearts!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You may be right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should dedicate ourselves foremost
to the happiness of the people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, <Philia> Felice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do your best to pray for the
happiness of all people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was that you who came by
the temple the other day?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some of the priests said they
could tell it was you because
you spoke to your swords.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was that you who came by
the temple the other day?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, of course you did. Who else would
go around talking to their blades?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We, uh, haven't had any particular
reason to come here...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? But... we gave them the 
lens that we were collecting...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems you were swindled by
someone pretendin' to be us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! You can't be serious!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Bishop <Ayles>! Those swordsmen
from the other day are back
demanding more lens!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it. They must have thought
the priests would be easy marks.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, we need to stop this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ruffian
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, hey! Are you refusin' to give
lens to the fellas savin' the world?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ruffian
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, what'll we do about
this, my Swordian?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, that's disappointing.
I was expecting those
Dark Wings guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ayles>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have no lens for the
likes of you! Begone!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ruffian
[ENDBLOCK]
You would defy us!? We
are Swordian Masters!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ruffian
[ENDBLOCK]
If you dare, then we'll punish
you with our Swordians!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ooh, really? Hey <Stahn>, c'mon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ruffian
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What do you think you're-!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ruffian
[ENDBLOCK]
WHO ARE YOU GUYS?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn> Aileron, 
Master of <Dymlos>, the
Swordian of Fire!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I'm <Rutee> Katrea,
Master of <Atwight>, the
Swordian of Water!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ruffian
[ENDBLOCK]
S-Seriously!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Return the lens you extorted. Now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ruffian
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm sorry!! W-We've
already used 'em up!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ruffian
[ENDBLOCK]
Please forgive us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You ended things decisively, without
even injuring your opponents.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've truly grown strong, you two.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course I have. <Dymlos>
is my partner, after all.<x00>
