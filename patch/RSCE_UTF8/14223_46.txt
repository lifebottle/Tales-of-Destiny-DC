[ENDBLOCK]
Did you find a natural hot spring?
It's a mixed bathing area.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, there are only old people
here. It's not my place to say.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You've found a giant
snowman. It's too big to
be made by human hands.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
And it's too well shaped to
be a natural creation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
No way, a monster!
It can't be ...can it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you found the candle
tree? The lights shining in
the snow-clear air.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's very moody.
...What? It's a dead language?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, let me share with
you an interesting story...
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Frostheim is famous for its hot
springs, but there is also a secluded
hot spring that can cure all kinds of
diseases in a remote place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course. You'll have to find
it yourself. It is, after all, a
hidden hot spring.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It is said that very large chunks
of snow appear overnight in the
area of Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What's a snowball?
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The last time I saw a peddler,
the number of travelers in the
city had declined due to the
event two years ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he was going to go make
some money since he had more.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Young people seem to be looking for
the hottest spots near the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Retired Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like someone's playing
a prank, but the people in town
seem to be very grateful.
[ENDBLOCK]

that I was here.

[ENDBLOCK]
Ughhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank goodness...
You're awake...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>?
Where am I...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're in the city
of Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We were saved, thanks
to our friends here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Long time no see, <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought I was a goner...
You all saved my life!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have my gratitude. I don't
know what I would have done
if you hadn't shown up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
They've been after us ever
since we left Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's no surprise, of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Why not...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Come on, guys!
What's with the stares?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You were traveling with <Woodrow>
and didn't even know who he was?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This man is <Woodrow> Kelvin,
Crown Prince of the Kingdom
of Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahhh... Right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...WHAAT!? Crown Prince
of Phandaria!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
A normal person would've recognized
that name immediately. ...A normal 
person, that is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>... Is this the reason you
 were so keen on helping him?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>She's obviously just in it
for the potential rewards.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Oh, shut up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never felt the
need to tell him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I also pretended I couldn't hear you.
I hope you can forgive me, <Dymlos>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...! You knew about me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, are you <Igtenos>' master?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's the name of the Swordian
that was enshrined here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am not.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Igtenos> was owned by my father,
the <King> of Phandaria, Isaac.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>..."Was owned?" Where
is <Igtenos> now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...It fell into the hands
of <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My father fought bravely against
the rebels attacking the castle, 
but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
He crossed swords
with <Greybum> and...
...He lost...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
So they took <Igtenos> from you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>I seriously doubt <Greybum> has the
makings of a Swordian Master.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If the <King> was overthrown, it's as
good as the end of this country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's terrible! Why
would you say that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>'s still
here, after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was truly a blessing that we
happened to be at the castle...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was able to stop <Woodrow> from
following in his father's footsteps.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you going to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've already dispatched
messengers throughout
the kingdom.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It will be some time before our
forces are ready, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No problem! We'll head to
Heidelberg first, then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, are you going to...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. The sooner, the better.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
A smaller group like us
is more mobile, anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is, we've been chasing
<Greybum> in order to recover the
Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had no idea...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go with you, then.
I know how to get in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wouldn't it be better for you
to stay in this city, <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Royal Family had grown complacent.
We thought we were untouchable. That's
the cause of this unrest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's my responsibility. I have
to set things right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then I'm coming too! I'll 
be with Lord <Woodrow>,
wherever he goes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What can a child like you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Phooey! I'm not a child!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Alba>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can take her with you.
Despite her appearance,
<Chelsea> is a skilled archer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whaddaya mean, "despite
my appearance?" Not you
too, grandpa! 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. Let's
all go together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll tell you how to
get to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
The fastest way would be
through that forest where
we met.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
As I recall, it was to the west,
after leaving Frostheim.
