<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's the same here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Why won't they buy our lenses!?
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that rumor was true!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Guys, listen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems the rumor that the lens 
exchange money ship got delayed is
true, but we need to keep calm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon's money transporting ship
got broken before it could depart.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like their replacement
ship is on the way.
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that true!?
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't believe it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The rumors are true,
but please stay calm.
[ENDBLOCK]
So it was true after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
Exchange my lenses first!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please listen. It seems
Oberon's ship got in trouble and
will be delayed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Then that rumor was true after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case all we can do is wait.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please listen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon's ineptitude caused the
money ship to be delayed.
[ENDBLOCK]
What!
[ENDBLOCK]
No choice but wait then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it okay for you to be lying?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it is a matter of public order.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way around it...
I'd like to think this is for the best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
But I think this will help
calm things down a bit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
But I think the lens rate might be
unstable in the future.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
But it's a lot better than not being
able to exchange it at all.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The recent uproar has caused

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed it is quite unbearable.
And I don't think I'd ever be able
to lie to Stahn.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
But I will lie if it is a
matter of public order.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was no way around it this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lens Merchant
[ENDBLOCK]
But I think the exchange rate
will stabilize a little now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, things should calm down
a little at least for now.

I was told that strange thing floating
in the sky is called the Shell.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Where did the lightning strike?
Near the city?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky was covered by the Shell.
Will we stay in the dark forever now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
A big hole was made in the Shell in
the neighboring country, I heard
they used a big weapon!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder what it looks like above
the Shell. I wish I could go see it.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
