Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
In Seinegald there are seven 
superior knight called the 
Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
I've met one of them, Master Lewein.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
He's as old as my grandpa, 
but he still look great!
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Long time no see, how was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken me 
for someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't go away. Come on,
let's talk about it again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you really someone else?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, sorry about that.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
As you realize your mistake, 
I'm fine then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I look the same as
someone you've met before?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If he look at you, he'll have 
an interesting reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
He seemed to be in a rush, so it 
was impossible to find him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Then you should find 
somebody who might know him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'll mistake 
you for him.

Barista
[ENDBLOCK]
Hi, there. Please enjoy your time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Barista
[ENDBLOCK]
I will stay here, as long as 
people want my drink.
[ENDBLOCK]
Barista
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that a meteorite fell
at Seinegald, is it true?
[ENDBLOCK]
Barista
[ENDBLOCK]
When you're having a hard time, it's 
better to think about something fun.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm tired of dealing with the 
drunken every day.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
I've had three weird customers. They
call themselves lens hunters, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that Heidelberg has fallen?
What will happen to this city?
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
I was afraid before, but I'm glad
it was all right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
Where the voice in the
sky came from?
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like the darkness is starting 
to cover all of the sky.
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
Because the darkness, even 
morning seems like night. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Waitress
[ENDBLOCK]
Please come back safely. I'll give
you a great service then.

[ENDBLOCK]
Customer
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon, the company
that buys the lens you find,
is a very big corporation. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Customer
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it true that chief of Oberon 
Corporation is behind all 
of this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Customer
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought Oberon Corporation was 
suspicious from the beginning. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>. Can you give 
<Dymlos> to me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, what are you talking about? 

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is, we were on the Draconis
because we were looking for <Dymlos>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have <Atwight>. And <Stahn> 
is my master now.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll pay you. You can get 
a lot of gald for an antique.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you kidding me?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmmmm...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry <Rutee>, but I can't do that.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why not?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos> isn't just any old sword. 
I won't sell or give it to anyone.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the right decision.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Give it up, <Rutee>!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmm...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, anyway... Do you want to 
become our bodyguard?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your bodyguard?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're heading to Harmentz 
in Seinegald.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Darilsheid isn’t too far from
Harmentz, is it?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, and after all, we're just
a couple of girls so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
If someone as strong and capable as you
were with us, it'd be a huge relief.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Strong and capable? Hehe

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be so easily fooled by 
obvious flattery.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, don't you agree?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mm, delicious.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm? Did you say something?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'd be a relief if <Stahn> came 
with us, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Traveling in a group is more fun.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's not like they're
disagreeing with each other.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's true that if it's just women, 
it might be dangerous.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ok! I'll become your bodyguard just 
until we get to Harmentz.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh!! Thank you!!


[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't really know what's going  
on, but I'm pleased to make your 
acquaintance again <Stahn>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Same here!

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You think I'll let you get away? 
When you're not looking, 
I'll take <Dymlos>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, I know exactly
what you're thinking.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The road before us shall be
a difficult one to traverse.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well. It's getting late, 
we should sleep. Tomorrow
we'll get an early start!

<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
