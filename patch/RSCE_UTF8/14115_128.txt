<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he gave it
to a friend, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't think he
meant an adult!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
Need something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me for prying, but did
a kid give you an instrument
a while ago?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah. This real nice kid
gave it to me when I ferried
him and his family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Well, that instrument
happens to belong to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, but may I
please have it back?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, but that's
impossible.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
I actually started playing it for
my customers during rides.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
Then a customer who liked it very
much asked me to give it to him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
I figured since it was gifted to
me, why not pay it forward?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this person
from Moreau?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
No... from Terazzi, I believe.
I think he said he was here
on business.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is starting
to get fun!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's head to Terazzi.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems there's been an
incident at that house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, what's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's been a bit of an incident.
One of my soldiers was attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who did it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, we arrested
someone, all right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong? You
don't look happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, are you saying this
girl attacked the soldier!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Fayte>!
I'm innocent!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>! You have
to believe me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is pretty hard to believe a little
girl would attack a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
But still...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it either.
Such a small girl...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Johnny>!
Help me! Please!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, with the way she's pleading,
we've got no choice but to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, can you wait a bit
before you deal with her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. We'll be holding
her here, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you ask around
in Moreau for more info?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
There may be people who
saw it happen nearby.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The incident took place at dawn. A
soldier was attacked in Moreau.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Actually, this is just one of many
similar, recent incidents.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
The soldiers who are attacked are
always left with two distinct cuts
on their bodies.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Based on the testimony of the soldiers
who were attacked, as well as witness
testimony, we've concluded that the 
culprit was this little girl.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
That said, another witness claims to
have seen the same girl elsewhere
when the attack took place.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that is why Lord
<Fayte> is allowing you to
investigate like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story, but would you like
to hear a summary of the incident?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I heard about the attack. 
Though, the girl they think did
it was playing with that cat at
the time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone wearing clothes from Shiden
really sticks out here, you know? Plus,
she was being really loud.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if she can
really talk to cats...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
A little girl, huh? Yeah, she
was here buying fish when
the incident happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
She sure took up a lot of time. Every
time I started packing up what she
said she wanted, she'd suddenly 
decide on something else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Fish Seller
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyone would remember a
weird customer like her.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a while back, but I saw
a young girl making a fuss at
the harbor fish market.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was kind of curious, but I
came right back to this inn.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
After I got back here, I opened up that
sliding door, and saw what had to be
the same girl coming out of that house
by the weapons shop!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It's quite the mystery. There's
not a secret passage in this
town everyone else doesn't
know about.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know who the culprit is!?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Then please head inside and
explain your findings to Lord
<Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Please return once
you've concluded your
investigation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Would you like to hear
about the case?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you, <Tiberius>... Oops!
Did I say that out loud?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
This city is known for its water
transportation, so we use small
boats to get around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going to happen to our lives
when that net thing fills up?
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
I lost my closest friends to
monsters. Our world must
be ending!
[ENDBLOCK]
Ferryman
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that the youngest prince of
Shiden? The one who's known
for being a drifter?
[ENDBLOCK]

I hope you've cooked up a
decent plan. Regardless...
We're counting on you.

Master <Fayte> only just became our

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]

<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady <Rihanna>, you're like
the queen of Moreau, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, could I ask you something?
I'd like to know what you do as
a queen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh?	Do you wish to become
a queen, <Chelsea>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not that. I'm already
certain to be queen! I
just want to be ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Well, first of all, being a
queen is far more difficult
than it appears.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, in the morning, one must
immediately dress themselves
when they wake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
R-Really...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you go out, as well. One
must always appear pristine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That sounds kinda annoying...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
There are always lessons
to attend every single day,
as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That sounds tough, but I can
handle that. ...I think...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
And on top of everything...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
You get wrinkles on your
face from being so busy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-W-Wrinkles...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Noooooooo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you hate being
queen, Lady <Rihanna>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not all all, it makes me proud
to see my people happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I'm very happy to be on the
same path as my husband.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please don't lose heart, <Chelsea>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes! I'll become a great
queen, just like you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady <Rihanna>, you're like
the queen of Moreau, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, but being queen is
a lot different from what you
imagine, <Chelsea>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's quite difficult. I swear
it'll give me wrinkles.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady <Rihanna>, you're
beautiful, so you'll be
fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe, but they say
beautiful women live
short lives...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
It feels like everything is all
right with the world. I hope
nobody ruins this peace.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can count on us
if that happens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. If push comes to shove,
we can always get help from
<Johnny>, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? Then I'll be
counting on you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, how is
<Johnny> doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's doing well, I believe. He never tells
anyone how he really feels, so it's hard
to tell if he ever gets tired.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
So what's the deal with that
clown act he puts on?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's our <Mary>. Always
asking what no one else
can bring themselves to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well... First, I need to
talk about <Fayte>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
About <Fayte>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. A long time ago, <Fayte>
had a girlfriend named <Eleanor>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem strangely calm talking
about his old flame~.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>, <Johnny>, and <Eleanor>
were all childhood friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny> would never
say it, but he was in
love with <Eleanor>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
However... <Eleanor> was
murdered by <Tiberius>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> was devastated. Compared
to how he is now, he became very
short-tempered.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was even cruel to <Johnny>, who
would normally cheer him up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, <Fayte> lost his temper
with <Johnny>. "You could never
understand my suffering!" he said.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was kind of
harsh, huh...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> also had a hard
time, didn't he...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think <Johnny> did understand
how much <Fayte> was suffering.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But... even though he was hurting
just as much, he wouldn't admit it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that day, <Johnny>
seemed to change.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
He started wearing flashy clothing,
never stepping into anyone's mind,
and never letting anyone into his...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte> still regrets what
he said to this day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why we'll do whatever
we can to help make <Johnny>
happy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotta say, I wasn't expecting them
to have this kind of history.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's why <Johnny> seems
like such a gentle guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gentle, huh? That's a kinda
sad way to put it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rihanna>
[ENDBLOCK]
It feels like everything is all
right with the world. I hope
nobody ruins this peace.<x00>
[ENDBLOCK]
