You see...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this about father?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Father?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Father lived in a very hot
place when he was a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And where is your father now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Father died in the last war.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be. Seeing someone looking
for him brings me joy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Here, I'd like you to have this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
That reminds me, father always used
to say there was someone he
wanted to meet in Neustadt.

Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you travelers?
Better not cause any trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We only want what's best for this
country. Overthrowing the Royal
Family is not our goal.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Could you be...
Your Majesty... King <Woodrow>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Declaring war on the entire earth...?
Are they serious?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
That thing blasted holes all over
the world...Is that Belcrant's power?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this mankind's final hour?
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I was instructed by captain
<Dalis> to collect lens...
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty <Woodrow>,
please save humanity.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We will mold Phandaria
anew by our own hands!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain <Dalis> negotiated with the
new king ensuring we aren't punished.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What are the Aeth'er Wars?
What's happening!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder how many would die if
Belcrant struck the city...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
How am I supposed to rest when all
I can think about is how Belcrant
may strike at any moment?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
We will do what we can here.
Please, save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We won the fight because
Lord <Greybum> was on our side.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
People were praising Lord <Greybum>
before, but now they're all
badmouthing him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, the grown-ups are just
putting all the blame on Lord <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky is looking weird.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky flashed and made a
loud sound out of nowhere.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
What will we do if the
whole sky is blocked?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
We sent all our lens to Heidelberg.
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
When did we start being
friendly to outsiders?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
If everybody joins forces together,
we will definitely win.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is it always dark outside now?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that if we collect a lot of
lens, something good will happen.

<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ngh... Walking on a snow-covered
road chills you all over...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Has this town also fallen
into rebel hands...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll wait outside of town for now.
There will be commotion if I'm seen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Rebel Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys don't look familiar.
Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhmmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that <Mary>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I know you?
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying?
We were comrades in arms, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
We...fought together...?
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought you died in the battle two
years ago! Damn, I can't believe it.
[ENDBLOCK]
I gotta let the captain know!
Wait here!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Did something happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain <Dalis>! Good, you're here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ma...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And you are?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Could you be...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
They look alike, but that's not her.
[ENDBLOCK]
It just...isn't possible...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are returning to Heidelberg.
You two, come with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
U-Understood.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
As soon as you are done with
your business, leave. Get out of
this country as soon as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you maybe an acquaintance
of <Mary>'s?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a second. You are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've been warned.
Next time there will be no warning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you remember something
about him, <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know... I don't know, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, are you okay!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My head is hurting a
little... but I'm fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
This place seems to be strongly
connected to her. Being here seems
to be unlocking her memories.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This city is...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, go call <Woodrow> and the
others. They can now enter the city
without drawing attention.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't <Mary>!
When did you come back?
[ENDBLOCK]
You seem to be in good health.
I thought you had died!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
U-...Umm...
[ENDBLOCK]
Good things keep happening! We took the
capital, and even managed to kill Isaac!
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe this is also Lord <Greybum>'s
influence. He seems to be a magnet
for good fortune.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you say Lord <Greybum>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will you be going back
to your house, <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My house...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>'s house? Where!?
[ENDBLOCK]
It's on the west side of town,
and its walls are green.
You can't miss it...
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I was in the middle of shopping.
Well then, I'll see you later.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems people from the royal
family are not welcome in this city...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
The things she said... How horrible...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let it get to you. I'm sure
<Greybum> deceived everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm afraid it isn't that simple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There are people in this country
who are receptive to <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
This town might be
a rebel army base.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be that as it may, it's better not
to overstay. Let's leave as soon
as we are done resupplying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before that... <Mary>, what do you
want to do? Want to try going to
your house?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I do. There's a chance going
might help me remember.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Certainly. Let's go, guys. We gotta make
sure what that woman said is true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow> is with us. It's best to
avoid unnecessary actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is not unnecessary.
It's important.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, we can't
just leave it be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...If it's unavoidable,
then hurry up and go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Woodrow>, is
something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
My father was famously
known as the "Wise King".
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why did he have such an unyielding
attitude towards Cyril...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize... That is a question I'll
have to find an answer for myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
And I suppose I won't succeed to the
throne until I have that answer.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani>
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles.
The first is to [Set your title and
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,
and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
