[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
This is bad...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! You're an acquaintance
of <Philia>'s, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Great! Please,
hear me out...
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
A while ago, while cleaning <Philia>'s
room for her, I found an ancient sword.
Not wanting it to get damaged, I stored it away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
But when I told <Philia> that, she
got really scary and demanded
I return it to her at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can certainly
see <Philia> saying that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is that a problem, though?
Just go get it out of storage.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Well...I've forgotten exactly
which room I put it in...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. The temple does
have a lot of storerooms.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, and I'm not able to
leave this spot for the time being.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
So if it's not too much to ask,
could you go find
<Philia>'s sword for her?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Old man Clemente might lose
his mind from the lonliness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's try to find him,
Master <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Guess I've
got no choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. I can't guarantee
I'll find it, but I'll go look.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you so much!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>'s sword should be in
one of the rooms here in the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>, it's
good to see you again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, great. You came
to get me, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? You're acting like
you didn't want to be found...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, no, I didn't.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
We were certain that you'd get
lonely cooped up in here yourself, sir...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you kidding? This
is the best kind of place!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's perfect for eavesdropping
on secret, forbidden meetings...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah, it's enough to make these
old bones of mine feel young again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Chal. We should get
him back to that priest quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Quickly. Please.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
No! Please no! Stop!
Noooooooooooooo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't wanna go!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, looks like you found it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know how
I can repay you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it.
Just never, NEVER do that again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You hear me?
Never again!!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-Why are you getting
so angry at me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's nothing to do with you.
Nevertheless, do as I say.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, here's
the sword back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope you've learned your lesson
about spying on other people, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, don't lecture me!
He's the one sneaking out at night!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's the one...?
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
Exactly what I said.
The priest in front of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-Yes? Did you need
something else...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you want to know
where I found it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yes, that's right!
Tell me, where was it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you know, where you...
you know...at night...
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
...At night?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-No, nevermind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just be careful
from now on!
[ENDBLOCK]
Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-Whew...!
[ENDBLOCK]
select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Destroy the barrier stone?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
That should've opened the door.
Let's go rescue the people inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
This will finally unseal the door.
Let's hurry back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's hurry back to the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's hurry back and
help those people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, this will
unseal the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will this unseal the door?
[ENDBLOCK]
Hurry back to the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go back to the door.
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright! The door has been unsealed.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
