Hey, long time no see!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know who you're talking
about. I think you're mistaken...
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
What a bunch of nonsense. 
Come on, tell me another story.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you're
not the same guy?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about that...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's alright no harm, no foul.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is the person you say you
met that similar to me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Your like double.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Would be interesting to you two
meet and look at your reactions.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
He was in a hurry so I don't
think you'll meet him soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Then you should try
to find someone who knows him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure everyone
will think you're him.
[ENDBLOCK]

Hey, I met you before, didn't I?

a huge fortune by secretly trading the
treasure of the ruins.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that he has a lot of
valuable treasures in his house.

[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
<Walt> is probably just trying to get
himself out of harms way, anyway.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
In this town, <Walt> took the
initiative to gather the lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe I was wrong,
about that guy...

I'm not going to let <Walt> get

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
