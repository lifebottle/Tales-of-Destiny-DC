<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Highness, would
you like to rest?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will everyone be resting?
Yes
No

[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Some of <Greybum>'s monsters will
reduce all of your abilities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't let your guard down.
[ENDBLOCK]
Weapon Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
I used to sell Weapons in the city.
If you see anything you'd like, 
just let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Item Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
I've brought some things from
the store. Feel free to use them if 
you need them.
[ENDBLOCK]
Uniques Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
What a time to be here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Uniques Shop
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome. What can
I do for you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Mr. <Darzen> brought me here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
He and I managed to escape.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
But I'm worried about my family who
fled separately. I hope they are safe. 
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The people here are the ones
who rebelled against <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Dear <Woodrow>, please restore the
city to its former peaceful state.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please restore the city
to its former peaceful state.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
No matter how many royalty
there is, you can't fight hunger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of <Greybum>, the people
in the castle are terrified.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
How does he control 
so many monsters?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, it's us, the rebels 
who are the most shameful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He said he wanted to change the
country, and in the end we bought
into everything <Greybum> was selling.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now we're at his mercy, committing
atrocities in the streets!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stupid ...<Dalis> would never
allow that to happen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
why do you still stand 
by that man?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about it.
Keep talking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
After all, His Majesty's 
decision was correct.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was only natural to conquer those
who were impious enough to threaten
the royal family.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean, threaten
the royal family?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, your highness didn't know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Two years ago, a party from Cyril
was here demanding independence 
from his former Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you refuse, you will have to resort
to armed struggle. This is no way to 
be arrogant.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
So the royal army was sent to Cyril.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
They threatened an uprising.
It's only natural that he'd do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Impossible...
<Dalis> wouldn't do such a thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where in the castle
is <Greybum> now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He is often seen in the tower.
That's probably where he is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course he'll be around. 
He's almost like a confidant
of <Greybum> now, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there only one place to go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know. I wonder what 
<Dalis> was thinking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did I really know
nothing about him?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, hold your ground. You've
come this far, you've got to find
out the truth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry, I'm here for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right. Let's settle this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If <Dalis> is, indeed, complicit 
with <Greybum>, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
At that time, please go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>, what was my late father
like from your point of view?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was a splendid monarch, worthy
of the name "Wise King.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
He was always thinking about the
country as a whole, and made precise
and sometimes decisive decisions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was never, ever a mistake
in the way he did things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Highness, the expectations
of the people now rest on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you have defeated <Greybum>,
please accede to the throne as soon
as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't know anything about it.
How sinful that is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if I'm qualified to 
take over from my father. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm coming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Family...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you doing there?
Come on, get your butt over here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess I won't be seeing him 
again once this mission is over.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
