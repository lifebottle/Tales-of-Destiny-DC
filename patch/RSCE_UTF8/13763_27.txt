[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if it isn't <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Currently on a mission,
Mr. <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well well. 
How about that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just as you would
have it, <Lewein>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn> Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? My name is
<Lewein>. Nicholas <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am one of the Seven 
Generals of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
General <Lewein>,
thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, nice to meet you.
<Stahn> Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aileron? Is it possible you are
related to Thomas Aileron...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know Thomas?
That's my grandpa.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so! I'm surprised to
see his grandson here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That? Maybe the officer
who helped me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
That? Maybe the officer
who helped me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was little, he would
tell me the story of when he
helped you all the time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, how is your grandmother?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, General.  
We're in a hurry to  
get a jump start on our mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, of course.
Sorry about that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need to send a letter to Thomas.
I hope to talk to you again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here, take this with you. I'm sure
you'll make good use of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll make a trip to
see Thomas soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright, hurry up.
Aren't you on an 
important mission?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, those people are...

Yeah, for sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the first
time we've met.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehh? But you guys said
you were lens hunters?

You're wronggggg!! We'd never be

These heroes are letting my grandson
train under them. I'm very grateful
for their service.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't get what you're
trying to achieve by pretending
to be heroes...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, okay, let's continue training!
The second rule of being a hero!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Let's go, <Stahn>. This isn't
something we need to butt in to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, sure. Well then
everyone, take care!

[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing. Just living out my days.

[ENDBLOCK]
Now I'm just resting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
He ran away from his hometown to
become famous, but no matter
what he tried, it didn't work out...

[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, I decided to settle
down in this village, where they
were most kind to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
We came back heartbroken and
devastated, but the people here
welcomed us warmly.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Grandson
[ENDBLOCK]
Doctor! How is your health?
Get some rest, and then get back
to practicing!
[ENDBLOCK]

That girl... still calls us teacher?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...There are things that have
worked, too, aren't there?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no! This story's going
to bring me to tears!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I've decided! I'll bury my
bones in this village! From now
on, let's do our best for the
village!
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think this was for the best. It's good
for these people, and for the
people of the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, it is.

The current leader of the temple

I heard that High Priest <Greybum>
is dead. I've suspected him from
the beginning.
[ENDBLOCK]
Former Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with that light? Why is
this happening to us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Former Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
He couldn't stand the boring life
in the temple, so he came out to 
the outside world...
[ENDBLOCK]
Former Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
When the world is resolved as
they say, I'll go back to the
temple.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's

Something fun may happen.
