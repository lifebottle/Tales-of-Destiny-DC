[ENDBLOCK]
Well, if it isn't
Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Has something happened?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm currently on an assignment,
General <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aha, I see! So
who's this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You just had to ask...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn> Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so? I'm <Lewein>.
Nicholas <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm one of the Seven
Generals of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nice to meet you,
General <Lewein>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, same here. <Stahn>
Aileron, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aileron... Might you be related
to Thomas Aileron...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know Thomas?
That's my grandpa.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really, now! I'm surprised
to see his grandson here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, could it be? The officer
Gramps told me about...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, that was me. I owe Thomas
a great deal for saving my life.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was little, he'd tell me
the story of how he saved you
all the time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the way, how is 
your grandmother?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My grandmother... she's-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, General <Lewein>.
We must hurry on with our
mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, of course.
My apologies.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need to send a letter to Thomas.
I hope we meet again, sometime.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Here, take this with you. I'm sure
you'll make good use of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take a trip to
see Thomas soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right, hurry up.
Aren't you on an
important mission?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, it's them again!
[ENDBLOCK]

we would meet again...

Huh? Aren't you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you forget? We
met back at Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-Nope! We don't know you! Aren't
you mistaking us for someone else?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, for sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the first

[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>

Huh? But you guys said
you were lens hunters!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're wronggggg!! We'd never

[ENDBLOCK]
I don't get what you're trying
to achieve by pretending to
be heroes...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, okay, let's continue training!
The second rule of being a hero!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Let's go, <Stahn>. This
isn't something we need
to butt into.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, sure. Well then,

[ENDBLOCK]
What are you
doing here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nothing. Just living
out our days.
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
Doing nothin' but restin'...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
We left our hometown to become
famous, but no matter what we
did, nothing worked...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, we decided to settle
down here, since they were the
kindest to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
We came back heartbroken
and down in the dumps, but
the people here were real
happy to see us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Grandson
[ENDBLOCK]
Master! How're you doing? Let's
take a break, and then we'll get 
back to practicing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
That kid... still calls us master?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Looks like you got what
you wanted after all, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whahh! What a heart
warming ending!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I've decided! I'll bury
my bones in this village!
From now on, let's dedicate
our lives to this place!
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
Me too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
Same!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is for the best. Not just for
them, but for the townspeople too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think so, too.
[ENDBLOCK]

Archbishop Merton is
the current leader of
the temple. 
[ENDBLOCK]

His successor will most

[ENDBLOCK]
High Priest <Greybum> has revolted?
That's a good one! Hahahaha...

[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that High Priest <Greybum>
is dead. I suspected him from the
start!
[ENDBLOCK]
Former Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
What's with that light? Why
is this happening to us?
[ENDBLOCK]
Former Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I couldn't stand the boring life
in the temple, so I came out to
the outside world...
[ENDBLOCK]
Former Priest
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll go back to the temple
once peace is restored...
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Grandson
[ENDBLOCK]
The first thing a hero should know
about is... to always stand out!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Grandson
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to be strong and protect
my mom and grandpa!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Grandson
[ENDBLOCK]
The master's gonna tell me
about the time he beat up 
the Dark Lord!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Grandson

Even though they're gone,
I'll never forget what they
taught me!

Some people had bad things 
to say about my master, but 
I always believed in him!
[ENDBLOCK]
Chief's Grandson
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll work together with them

Sheep are nice, aren't they? Just
looking at them is soothing, isn't
it?
