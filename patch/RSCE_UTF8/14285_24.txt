Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>I'm not connected to the royal family.
Is something wrong, boy?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh. I would have sworn you
were definitely <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, watch yourself. You look a lot
like him. People may do crazy things if
they think you're <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you... <Woodrow>?
King Isaac's son?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? Really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You aren't worried about people
finding out who you are?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I were to hide or
evade the question...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
It does no good to lie to
others. That's all, really.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you are so much cooler than
I thought you would be, <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh, it can't be...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who, me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007> You seem familiar...
I'm sorry. I don't know who you are.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You look well, Miss <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's strange. I can recall your face,
but I can't seem to remember you
at all...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha. Don't worry about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I was just a simple
mercenary, you see.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I was working a job here a
while back and remember
seeing you around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you remember me,
even if it's only my face.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You haven't been back for
some time. I was about to
give up seeing you again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that so...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It doesn't matter now.
It's a good day to be
alive.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If a beauty like you were to
die, there wouldn't be much
to look forward to in life.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
In such a case, I would want
you to take me with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no, don't worry about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
We should be able to survive
in the world as it is.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It's all thanks to the leadership
of the King of Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
We can still live in this
world thanks to him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
How strange... I thought
people hated the king.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, <Woodrow>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
King <Woodrow>! Wh-where
are my manners...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your words came from your heart.
I'm glad you shared them with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I alone cannot take
all the credit. We need to give
thanks to <Mary> and <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so happy to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Speaking of <Dalis>, are you
going to see him <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You guys don't mind?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Go ahead.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
The door is locked.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain <Dalis> is amazing. 
Even two years in a cell 
couldn't take him out.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that he gets better soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
What is the Aeth'er War...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Belcrant...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Recently it's been getting colder and
colder. I wonder if it's because the
sky is pitch black.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Its the secret lens weapon that's
going to blast holes through that
thing covering the sky, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Go, King <Woodrow>, go!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You got this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm so glad Captain
<Dalis> is still with us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain <Dalis> was always a kind
and gentle man, not the kind of
person who liked conflict.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Amid the turmoil two years ago, he
carried the burden of becoming a
leader to his people.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I think everyone
is sick of war.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
At this rate, not only this city,
but the entire country will be
smothered by ice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You are only gathering lens?
What about food?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>? You're still alive!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen you
people before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If I were <Mary>, I'd be with Captain
<Dalis> at a hot spring in Frostheim.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>? You're still alive!
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen you
people before.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary> and her husband are
not able to be together...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary> and her husband are
not able to be together...
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
With such a strong bond, I'm
sure they will be all right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder when the day will come
where we will have peace of mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
If that Belcrant were to attack our
town directly... it'd be devastating.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if this is punishment
for our sinful existence.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, if you were able to persevere,
we should be able to do the same.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
There's plenty of lens in Heidelberg.
Go on, now. Collect it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
There's plenty of lens in Heidelberg.
Go on, now. Collect it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
It is your duty to ensure that
<Mary> makes it back alive.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Woman
[ENDBLOCK]
You come back alive, you hear me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Lord <Greybum> is the reason
we are where we are today.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> only used us in order
to subjugate the entire country.
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that we have reconciled with the
royal family... What happens next?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the point in shoveling
snow if the city is going to be
destroyed...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I intend to keep on doing what
I can to help everyone.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
