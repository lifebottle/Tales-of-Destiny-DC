[ENDBLOCK]
Hm? Aren't you...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You talking about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's right! You're that
guy who managed to beat <Lilith>
in the arena right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You talking about me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I-It's you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got some nerve,
talking like I'm not here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, anyway, is there
something you need?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What? W-Well, Uhh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith> will be okay.
Please tell us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, I received an interesting
report I was going to tell you about.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Really?
What is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
A while back, some pirates
attacked this city, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, when we
fought <Batista>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it seems that one of 
the ships was sunk during
the fighting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
It's possible that some
treasure had sunk with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure it's okay for
you to share this report
with us like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, the ship's underwater. It's
not like I can go there myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Lilith>,
say thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you very much!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish I was stronger.
I'm kinda useless, huh?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
The Oberon Corporation's presence
in the city has been controversial.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a long-time resident, but I think
it's good for the city to develop.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Ms. <Ilene> evacuating the citizens
without worrying about
herself was so admirable...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Has <Ilene> given up
on this city...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegald sent a large number
of soldiers to the damaged area.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Yet the government of this
country isn't doing a thing!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
The government doesn't do anything,
even though we don't know if the
city will be attacked again or not!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Rather than waiting for the powers
that be, I was thinking of doing
what I could, myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't much, But I gave
what lens I could.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know why that barbarian,
<Kongman> or whatever, is so
popular.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> took out an armada alone!?
Hmm... maybe I was wrong about him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, are you going somewhere?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, where's <Kongman> going?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, you're the hero of this
city right? Then do your job!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, I was wrong. I'm
sorry for being so selfish.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Good luck in your quest to save
the world! Mighty! Mighty! Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Go get 'em, <Kongman>!
Mighty! Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Those obsessed with material
gains are always lacking in
spiritual fulfillment.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
More than ever, this city needs
a branch of Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish we had a temple
in this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
It is at times like this that we
should spread the teachings of
Atamoni to the people of the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this another test that
Atamoni has given us...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sister
[ENDBLOCK]
Atamoni will surely be a guide
on your path ahead.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
We're still getting ready for our

[ENDBLOCK]
It demonstrates the effective monster
killing technique, "Definite Strike."
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Take good care of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can perform a Definite Strike
by setting [Definite Strike] to "ON"
from the Customize menu in the 
Main menu.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
You can also view each monster's
Definite Strike in the Monster Book
if Definite Strike is "ON."

[ENDBLOCK]
I don't have anything
else to give you.
[ENDBLOCK]

Come back when you've
honed your skills more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
So this is Neustadt... the city
at the heart of Fitzgald.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My hometown Lienea's
here in Fitzgald, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No time for that now, though.
We gotta find <Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, we're going to
visit <Ilene>'s estate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Ilene> is head of the Oberon
Corporation's Fitzgald branch.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Good idea. We could certainly
make use of her influence.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Prepare a ship. We're going to
strike back at that armada.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait! I'm going with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to protect our town!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> is doing her best, too. I'm
not going to let her outdo me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right! Let's
fight together!
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
When you're ready, just give
me a shout, and we'll set sail!
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain
[ENDBLOCK]
There's a considerable amount
of enemy ships. As soon as we
leave port, we'll attack!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bring 'em on! I'll smash every
last one of 'em to bits!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Our goal is the flagship. We don't have
time to do a thorough search.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, we have to put an end
to this, and fast. Get us to
the biggest ship out there!
[ENDBLOCK]
It's gonna be a bit rough,
so hold on tight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for the warm
welcome, folks!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Champion, <Kongman> has
crushed the evil armada, and
brought peace back to the city!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Mighty!	Mighty!	Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Mighty!	Mighty!	Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
...It's not like he did
it all by himself...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sick of all this noise. Let's
head back to <Ilene>'s estate.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just remembered something I need
to do. Go on ahead without me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmmm. <Stahn> looks pretty
worried about <Ilene>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wonder if he likes
older women...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, are you... jealous?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-Not at all! I would never!
It's impossible! Completely
out of the question!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wow, you shot that down
with everything you could!
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm... What was
with that ship?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you
talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
While you all were fighting
out at sea, a ship from the
armada came this way...
[ENDBLOCK]
But then it left almost immediately.
So what the heck was that about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
A ship...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you get close to Aquaveil,
please use a rowboat to get to
land.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for setting
this up, <Ilene>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wahh... <Philia>, you're really
leaving, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I weren't helping to rebuild
the city, I'd come with you in 
a heartbeat!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
There, there. The townspeople
need you, <Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, you're so kind! What
an inspiration! Uwahhhhh!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's one way to put it.
Glad he's taking it so well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>! You are to protect
<Philia> in my place!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If anything happens to her,
I will destroy you!!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry, it'll be fine.
You can count on me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, we're off. Really,
thank you so much!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, don't forget about our
challenge from earlier, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't forget. Who'll realize
their ideals first, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope next time we meet, we'll
both have made progress.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ideals, huh...? Wonder if
that's something easier 
said than done?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
F-Forget it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then,
take care!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's get onboard.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on, you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, hey, <Kongman>!
How've you been?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the champion!
I've been great!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going to Phandaria,
right? I'm coming with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the champion, though. Is it
okay for you to leave the city?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It'll be fine! Besides, I'm
worried about you guys.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I appreciate the concern, but you
don't have to push yourself...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to hide
your feelings for me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Feelings...? What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, I'm coming with you!
I've already decided!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well okay, <Kongman>! We'll
be counting on you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Leave everything to me!
Ga-ha-ha-ha!

[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
At this rate, the town will be so full of
people, we'll be packed like sardines!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
On top of that, all they do is complain
and make noise... I'm utterly sick of it!
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you! You're the one who
won't stop complaining!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
This town's full enough as it is,
go back to your own country!
[ENDBLOCK]
Seinegaldian
[ENDBLOCK]
How uncivilized. People
like you make me sick!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, you might
as well leave!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Talk about the pot calling the kettle
black. Get the hell out of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!? It's because of people like
you that this city will never flourish!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
HEY! Cut it out, all of you!
What's come over you!?
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You stay out of this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everybody, calm down! What
would <Ilene> think of this?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene> took off, didn't she?
She was nothing more than
a mouthy idealist.
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
You're wrong. She was
completely deluded.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did you say!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, cut it out. What'll we
do if you lose your cool?
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't kid around. Whatever <Ilene>
claimed to do for this city, there's
nothing to show for it at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not true at all! Ms. <Ilene>
taught us lots of things!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
Adults, both the rich and the poor,
only care about themselves!
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
But we're different.
[ENDBLOCK]
Kid
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Some way or another,
we will find a way to change this city!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, everyone! Are you
really going to let the kids leave
you in the dust like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I reckon we can't
say they're wrong!
[ENDBLOCK]
City Person
[ENDBLOCK]
It's... definitely pathetic to be
called out like this by kids...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. That's right!
We should all work to make
this town the best it can be!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>... Looks like you've pulled
ahead of me in our little wager.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
More than ever, arguments
are breaking out.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't there a City
Hero around?<x00>
