You'd like to buy some food?
Please wait just a moment!
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Oh for the love of...
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
That moron! He forgot
to restock, again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is something wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, actually... I don't have
what you need to cook.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
My husband, out of nowhere,
said he wanted to go on a trip
and just up and left me here!
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
This is awful...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't that what you liked
about him, though?
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
...W-Well...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If so, are you going to support
your husband with all you have?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Or would you rather knock him on
his back and tell him to shut up?
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahaha, you have a point.
I'd probably do the latter!
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't refill your food this time
around, but I'll give you a freebie
next time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
What's your name?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
Please make sure
to come again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, come again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grocer
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks for shopping with me.
How can I help you?

Welcome, travelers.
Would you like a room?
[ENDBLOCK]
 Gald.
Is that okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Enjoy your stay.
[ENDBLOCK]
Please come back anytime.
[ENDBLOCK]
Have a good day.
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have enough Gald.

Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it strange for a woman
dressed like me to go to
the temple?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
The priest's clothes are cute,
aren't they? I'd love to trade
outfits with him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
I was told not to go outside the
village because the monsters are
getting more violent.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been waiting here for so long...
I might as well work here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
I asked the Innkeeper if I could
work for him. But he straight
up refused me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worshipper
[ENDBLOCK]
If I were there, they'd double
their sales, easy!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
