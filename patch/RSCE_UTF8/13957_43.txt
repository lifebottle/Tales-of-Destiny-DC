Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's up?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you from out of town?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Why does
that matter?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, have you heard
of the Dark Wings?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Dark Wings? Nope,
never heard of 'em.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, we met those
guys back in Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah! You know them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you so excited?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean, they're like a group
of has-been comedians.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Has-been... comedians?
Oh, who cares.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm actually a huge
fan of their group!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Since you know them, maybe
you could ask if they would
make me their apprentice?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You want to be... a comedian's
apprentice?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, it's settled then!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's settled?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
You're going to help me run away from
home to become their apprentice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehhhh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>, come here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This kid's pretty far gone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not good to run away from
home. I'm not one to talk, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, let's do something
to stop it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, I think running from home
would get the Dark Wings in trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, why don't you
write a letter first?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
You're right!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll write them first asking
them for their favor!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's a good idea!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
But, where should
I send the letter?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh well, that's not important.
I'm going back home to write
it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He seems to be quite the
character, that kid...
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Big Bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah, I became an apprentice
under the Dark Wings.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been learning a lot from
them through our letters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Through letters?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, it's called the Correspondence
Apprenticeship Course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what are they
teaching you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
How about I show you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Here I go!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, how was that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Amazing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to try it too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph!

If you go south you'll hit Cherik,

[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You're from Cherik?
How did you get this
far?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The people of Cherik aren't very
respectful to outsiders, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why there are
so few who go there.
[ENDBLOCK]

If you go south you'll hit Cherik,

You can perform a Definite Strike
by setting [Definite Strike] to "ON"
from the Customize menu in the

Definite Strike in the Monster Book

[ENDBLOCK]
Where did he go...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's nowhere to be found...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tch...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's terrible, but we've
completely lost him...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Master, let's go back.
I'm worried about the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No. We're not going back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're too much of a burden.
They'll jeopardize the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Surely something like this is
bound to happen again... We
have to leave them, Chal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>What!? B-But...! Are you
sure this is okay!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that you, <Lion>!? I 
had a feeling I'd find
you here in Calviola.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
So tell me, did you recover what
you were searching for?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We found it in a room hidden inside
the temple, but the culprit managed
to escape with it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... By the way, what about
the others that were with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're back at the temple.
When I left, they were still
fighting monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you intend to chase
after the culprit alone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. In that case,
let me help you out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want you to help <Lion>
pursue the culprit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, alert the mercenaries outside
and tell them to come to the temple
at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir. What
will you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll lead the mercenaries to the
temple in order to rescue <Lion>'s
companions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on. They aren't critical
to the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no need for
you to go out of your
way for them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be that as it may, surely you don't
expect me to just abandon them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
But why...? You live here in this
harsh desert, you know what you
must do to survive, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Those people are a burden. In spite
of that, you're still risking your life
for the likes of them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, what you're saying does
have some truth to it... However,
that doesn't mean I agree.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything I've done would be for
nothing if it meant sacrificing
others to achieve my own goals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that you don't need
a reason to help people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't... need a reason...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! Look out!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. I'm off. You be
careful as well, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Wait...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about the culprit?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We don't have time to argue.
Come on, we need to hurry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
After you notify the mercenaries,
see to it we find out everything
we can about this criminal.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, let's get moving. We
can't expect greatness 
from these mercs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. You're going to get
yourself hurt. Let me help.
