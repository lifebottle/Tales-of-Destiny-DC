Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you guys!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's up?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you from out of town?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
Something wrong with that?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, have you heard
of the Dark Wings?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Dark Wings?
Nope, never heard of them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, I met those
guys back in Janos.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehh!!!
You know them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why are you so excited?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I mean, they're like a
group of comedians. 
やつらの事で。
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Comed...ians？
Well, whatever.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm actually a huge
fan of their group!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're acquainted with them,
could you ask if they could
make me their apprentice?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Apprentice?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You want to be... a 
comedian's apprentice?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I've decided!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Decided what?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going to run away from home
and become their apprentice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehhhh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey <Stahn>, come here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This guy's pretty far gone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not good to run away from home.
I can't speak for others, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, let's do something
to stop it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know, I think running from home
would get the Dark Wings in trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, why don't you write a letter first.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
You're right!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll write first then ask for a favor!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's a good idea!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
But, where should I send the letter?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, whatever.
I'm going back home to write it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
He seems to be quite the
character, that kid...
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh! Big Bro.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh yeah, I became an apprentice
under the Dark Wings.
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been learning a lot from
them through our letters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
By letter?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, it's called the Correspondance
Apprenticeship Course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, what are they teaching you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
How about I show you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
And this!
[ENDBLOCK]
Toshu
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehe, how was that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Amazing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uh, really?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll try it too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph!

[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man

[ENDBLOCK]
That's why there are so few

<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where did he go...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's nowhere to be found...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tch..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's terrible, but
we've completely lost him...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Young master, let's go back. 
I'm worried about the others.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No. We're not going back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're too much of a burden.
They'll jeopardize the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Something like this will surely
happen again, later on.
...We have to leave them, Chal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? B-But..!
Are you sure this is OK!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that you, <Lion>!?	
I had a feeling I'd find
you here in Kalviola.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
So tell me, did you recover
what you were searching for?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
We found it in a room hidden
inside the temple, but the 
culprit managed to escape with it..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...By the way, what about
the others that were with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're back at the temple.
When I left, they were 
still fighting monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you intend to chase after
the cuplrit like this? Alone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. In that case,
let me help you out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want you to help
<Lion> pursue the cuplrit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, alert the mercenaries
outside and tell them to
come to the temple at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir.
What will you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll lead the mercenaries
to the temple in order to
rescue <Lion>'s companions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on. They aren't
critical to the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no need for you
to go out of your way for them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even so, surely you don't
expect me to just abandon them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
But why..? You live here in
this harsh desert, you know
what you must do to survive, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Those people are a burden.
Despite this, are you really
going to risk your life for them??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, what you're saying
does has some truth to it...
However, that doesn't mean I agree.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything I've done would be
for nothing if it meant sacrificing
others to achieve my own goals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that you don't 
need a reason to help people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't...need a reason..?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! Look out!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright. I'm off. 
You be careful as well, OK?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Wait..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm going with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about the culprit?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've made this decision myself.
Come on, we need to hurry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
After you notify the mercenaries,
see to it we find out everything
we can about this criminal.
[ENDBLOCK]
Oberon Employee
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Baruk>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK, let's get moving. Don't expect
those mercenaries to do everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. If it looks like you're
in danger, I'll help you out.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
