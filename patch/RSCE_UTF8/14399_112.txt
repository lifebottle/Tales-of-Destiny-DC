<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Lilith> isn't here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where the hell did you 
go this time of night?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Lilith>.
What are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's unusual for you to 
be up at this hour.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm usually so sleepy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I kind of woke up suddenly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big brother. Do you 
remember mom and dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My mom and dad.
What's wrong with them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sometimes I miss mom and dad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have you ever felt that 
way about mom?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I guess I used to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hardly ever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Why?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story, but if
that's okay with you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I want to hear it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
This was when <Lilith> 
was still very small.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You had a fever once, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, I didn't know that happened.
I don't remember anything about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa happened to be out 
of the house at the time, and 
there was no one at home.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I really thought that 
you were going to die.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The thought of that terrified  me
and I didn't know what to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
At that time, I really wished  that
mom and dad would come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
And then a miracle happened, 
and my fever went down?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
On the contrary, Your face 
became redder and redder.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was in so much pain that I
was calling out to mom and
dad like a baby.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I saw that, I suddenly 
felt like I had to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I immediately took your and 
ran to the village chief.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then the village chief rushed 
to call a doctor for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why I'm able to talk
to you like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? But why was that the 
last time you wanted to see 
mom or dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's because they're not here
anymore. They can't help protect 
<Lilith> even if they wanted to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why I was too scared to 
do anything, so you came to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
He said, "Be brave and protect 
your sister."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought maybe he was 
trying to cheer me up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that, I feel like mom and 
dad are always there for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. I don't know how to describe 
it, but I guess it's like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's go to bed early, <Lilith>.
I'm starting to feel sleepy again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, what's up?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish I could stay with 
my brother forever, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to be
protected forever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will I be able to protect someone
like my big brother someday?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know about that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I know, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But when the time comes for <Lilith>
to truly want to protect someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure that's why Dad and Mom 
came to <Lilith>'s side and...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you're supportiing me, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I guess so.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for telling me
everything, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>I saw something I shouldn't have seen.

[ENDBLOCK]
Do you want to rest?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, by the way, <Lilith> is gone.
Where did she go?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
When I told my granddaughter 
about the legendary carrot, she
ran out of the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I think he's still near the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
The legendary carrots are 
said to be in the forest far
to the south of this village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard that some monsters 
are guarding carrots.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful.

[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of <Lilith> for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I used to be a soldier of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure my grandchildren 
are in the midst of working 
on that dream right now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If we meet somewhere else, 
please let me know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
This is your home. Make yourself
at home as much as you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope you will all feel at home here
and relax as much as you like.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Follow the path you believe in,
<Stahn>. That is the way of life 
for a man of House Aileron.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
From my point of view, <Stahn>
is still a child. Thank you very 
much for your cooperation.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you have your work cut
out for you. You can't just sit 
here and sell oil.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith> and <Stahn>, please.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are tired, please 
come back anytime.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, you've got a good look.
You'll be fine then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah... You're the one
from back then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you come to see me, by chance?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, I gave up looking 
for the legendary carrot.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um, I don't want you to come
into mine and my brother's room
without permission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, big brother!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet you're hungry. Do you want 
me to make you something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you hungry, also?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of the shopping 
for dinner, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I won't understand if you forget 
your promise, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of my brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to worry about 
me or grandpa, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of my brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
When it's all over and you come 
back, I'll make you a feast.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
To tell you the truth, I want my 
brother to come home soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Listen, Grandpa.
He's a terrible brother!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
What the heck, <Stahn>, you're still 
annoying <Lilith>, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't really mean to be.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're not aware of it, 
and that's the problem.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother, you really can't 
do anything without me.
[ENDBLOCK]
If it's a family member, that's
fine, but I hope you didn't bother
your buddies during your ...trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure it's fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Travelling to...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's already been three months since 
then. I hope everyone is well.

<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!

up one you like, so you can set it on

Why don't you go home and rest 
for the first time in a while?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I will.

[ENDBLOCK]
Aaaaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, Lilith?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was someone peeking
through the window!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? Did you get 
a look at their faces?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
No. I couldn't tell for sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I get it. I'll go see if I can
find anyone suspicious.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've found some shady people
from around the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother, you're so brave!

Who the hell are you?
Tell me who you are!

<Bacchus>

That's right, fess up!

And you're one of them!

[ENDBLOCK]
Me too!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
I had nothing to do with 
that. <Bacchus>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't me!

Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know him either. 
This is the guy, right?
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't me!

No, not <Bacchus>...

Oh!	<Stahn>, you get it, don't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure, big brother?
Okay, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The culprit is in here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's not me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
So who the hell peeked in the bath?

<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
Young Person
[ENDBLOCK]
Was it you?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've shown your true colors!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
True colors?
So it's the girl then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, this boy is the one who 
peeped into <Lilith>'s bath!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't dare explain why I had 
asked everyone to come.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The two of them saw that 
<Lilith> was angry and just 
reflexively denied it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
But, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not a good idea to offend 
<Lilith> for any reason.

<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, you've got
to give up now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
...... I peeked into your sister's bath.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a great big brother.
What's your name?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll remember that name!
My name is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you doing? You idiot!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
But still, it's amazing <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm surprised to see you've 
suddenly changed your mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I tried to imitate the 
main character of a book I 
read a long time ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was cool.
Big brother!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, I'm back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I worred you had someting to do with
that thing in the sky. I've been 
worried about you for a long time,
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Haha, but I'm really glad. It looks 
like your business is done, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa will be home soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You know what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. What do you 
want to eat, big brother?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh? I'm not. What do you 
want for dinner tonight?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to ask me 
anything special today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>...
I'm not done with my business yet.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no, no... I knew it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew it would come to this, 
when I saw my brother off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, your still in the middle 
of your business...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you need to 
do now, big brother?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since by brother left, I've been 
determined to do something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
He said that I shouldn't 
sway his decision.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
And best of all...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
He said I had to be strong too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Come on, swear to me
that you'll do what your
brother does!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll bring back the peaceful 
sky once again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear to you, brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will be stronger than anyone
else so that my favorite brother's 
promise can be kept!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big brother, you must 
keep your promise!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, and <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!

Woohoo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, Jonathan?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if I used a bow, I wouldn't
be able to hit something like that.

This young lady?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea> is very good with a bow.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll ask you to do it, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
There was something stuck on the 
top of the tree in front of my house.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I think if you hit the arrow 
close enough, it will fall.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I understand.
I think I'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll have to help with something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's okay, <Lilith>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be right back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, you're early.
Are you done already?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I'm done with it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's an egg.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this what's been bugging you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's hatched!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, she's so cute.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm a little afraid of...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not fair, <Lilith>!
I'm the one who found you. Buu.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you think <Lilith> 
is your mother?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith> will be responsible 
for taking care of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh~. My brother is enough for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, take him for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, take him for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
How'd it go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was really nice.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, but what are you 
going to do now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa. Can I ask you to 
take care of her for a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
You're still going to be 
with Stahn, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I'm sad to leave her, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
It's cute to think of him 
as our third grandchild.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you talking about, Grandpa?
"Great-grandchild".
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Ho-ho-ho. That's right.
You're <Lilith>'s child, aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Grandpa.
Where's the girl?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know where she is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then we have to find her!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did that girl just spontaneously
disappear?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yes.
I'm sorry, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did she grow up?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh. she's much, much more grown 
than I was when I was born.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe it was a nesting trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sad that I won't be able 
to see him anymore, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a mother.
I should be happy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right <Lilith>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's too early for your 
brother to leave the nest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time you see him, maybe 
he'll bring his wife and kids!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If something like that happens,
<Lilith> can't be bothered with 
<Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Give me a break~.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Ho-ho-ho.<x00>
