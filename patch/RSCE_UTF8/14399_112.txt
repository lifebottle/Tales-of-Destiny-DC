<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Lilith> isn't here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's so late at night... Where
could she have gone?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Lilith>. What
are you doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big bro. It's
not like you to be
up so late.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're usually such
a sleepyhead.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just kind of woke
up out of nowhere...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big bro? Do you remember
mom and dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. I see.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What about mom
and dad, <Lilith>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I just... I miss them,
sometimes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't you miss
them, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I guess
I used to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
But not anymore?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hardly ever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh... How come?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's a long story. Do you
really want to hear it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. Please,
tell me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It happened when you
were still really little,
but..
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You got a really
bad fever once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, did that happen?
I don't remember at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gramps happened to out
at the time. There wasn't
anybody else home...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
At the time, I... I thought
you were gonna die...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big bro...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was so scared... I didn't
know what to do...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd pray and wish so hard
that mom and dad would
come back and help me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then, like a miracle,
my fever went down?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The opposite. Your face
got more and more red.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was horrible... You started
mumbling, calling out for mom
and dad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When that happened, I knew I
had to do something, anything!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I scooped you up and ran as fast
as I could to the chief's house.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When he saw that you were
sick, he hurried and got a
doctor for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So thanks to you, I'm able to
talk with you, my big brother,
happy and healthy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? But wait, what's that got
to do with you not missing mom
and dad?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because they're not here, anymore.
They can't do anything to help,
even if they wanted to.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And so, even though I was
terrified and couldn't do
anything...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone called me a hero
for coming to my sister's
aid and saving her... 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought maybe they were
trying to cheer me up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since then, though, I guess I
felt like mom and dad were
always with me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I can't really explain
it, but that's how I feel.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, anyway, let's go
back to bed, <Lilith>.
I'm starting to feel
sleepy again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, big bro?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, what is it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'd love to stay with
you forever, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to be
protected forever.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will I be able to protect
someone one day, like 
you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not something
I'd know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...You're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, I think the time will come when
you want to protect someone with all
of your heart, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
And when that happens, I'm sure you'll
feel mom and dad's presence nearby...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I reckon they'd want to help
you in any way they could.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I think so too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for talking to
me like this, big bro.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>You saw something
you shouldn't have!
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you want to rest?
Yes
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
That reminds me, <Lilith>'s not
back yet. Wonder where she
got off to?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
When I told my granddaughter about
the Legendary Carrot, she dashed
off out of the village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
She's probably still somewhere
near Lienea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
The Legendary Carrot is said
to sleep in the forest far to
the south of this village.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I've heard a mighty beast
guards the carrot, as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful.

[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care
of <Lilith> for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I used to be a soldier 
of Seinegald.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I reckon my grandkid's out chasing his
dream of following in my footsteps.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If you ever meet him, I hope
you'll take good care of him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
This is your home. Make yourself
as comfortable as you'd like.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope you will all feel at
home here. By all means,
put your feet up.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, follow the path you
believe in. That is the way
of life for an Aileron man!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
From my point of view, <Stahn> is still
a child. Please take good care of him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, you have your work
cut out for you. You can't
just sit here and dawdle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, keep <Stahn>
in line, now.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If you ever get tired,
come back any time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm, you've got strong willed
eyes. I know you'll be fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it's you again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did you come back
to visit me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, I gave up looking
for the Legendary Carrot...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... You shouldn't barge into
people's rooms without
permission, you know.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I bet you're hungry. Do you want
me to make you something?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you hungry, too?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm trusting you with the
dinner shopping, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you forget our promise, I'll
never forgive you, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care
of my brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't have to worry about
me or grandpa, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care
of my brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
When it's all over, come back
and I'll make you a feast!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
To tell you the truth, I want my
brother to come home soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
See, Grandpa? Isn't
big bro the worst!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Goodness, <Stahn>. You really
mustn't trouble <Lilith> so.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I didn't mean to!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You never mean to! You
never notice, either!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You really can't do anything
without me, huh, big bro?
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, family forgives easily. I just hope
you didn't bother your companions on
your journey!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think I did.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My journey...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Man, it's already been three months
since then, huh? I hope everyone's
doing all right...

<Stahn>, you are a young man
of Lienea. When you are tired,
don't hesitate to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been a while since you came
home. Why don't you rest a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I will.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
EEEEEK!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong, <Lilith>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
There was someone peeking
through the window!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!? Did you
see their face!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
No... I didn't get a very
good look at them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gotcha. I'll go see if I can
find any suspicious people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, I brought all the suspicious
people around the house that I saw.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good work, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, confess!
Who was it!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Confess immediately!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're under suspicion
too, you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I am!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I've got nothing to do with this.
Besides, it was <Bacchus>, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't me!
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea either, but...
It was probably this guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
It wasn't MEEE!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah, it wasn't <Bacchus>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ahh, <Stahn>!
You understand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that true, big bro?
Well if that's the case...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Still, the culprit
is in here!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you serious!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I-It wasn't me though...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, who the heck peeked
into the bathroom then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Peeked into the...
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
...Bathroom?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
H-Huh!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you show your
true colors!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
True colors...?
So it was this kid?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right, this kid's the
perpetrator in the Great
Bathroom Peeper Mystery!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
When I was gathering everyone
up, I didn't dare explain my
reasons for doing so!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Upon seeing <Lilith> angry,
these two reflexively denied
any wrongdoing at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
B-But...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
They just knew that <Lilith>
being angry was really bad.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, give it up already!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this true?
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes. I'm the one who peeked
into your bathroom window...
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
You've got a real cool big
brother. What's your name?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Boy
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be sure to remember that
name well! My name is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Just what the heck are
you doing, you idiot!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What was that about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Bacchus>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, anyway, that was really
cool of you, <Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I was real surprised there.
it's like you turned into a
completely different person.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
N-Nah... I just... was acting
like the main character in a
book I read a long time ago...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're the best, big bro!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, I'm back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank goodness...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feared you had something to
do with that thing in the sky.
I've been worrying about you
for so long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whew... I'm so relieved. You've
come back for good, this time...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, no, I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa will be home soon...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
About that...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, right! What do you
want to eat, big bro?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't "Huh?" me. What do you
want for dinner tonight?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you going to ask me for
anything special today?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>, I... I still have
things to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
//TODO fix this
[ENDBLOCK]
No...
I knew it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since I saw you off,
I knew this would happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, big bro...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So... You're still not
done with your duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
So what should you be doing
right now, big bro!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
W-What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you left, I made
a promise to myself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said I wouldn't
sway your decision.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
But most importantly...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
You said I had to be strong too!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Come on, big bro! Swear
to me that you'll do it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll bring the sky back. I promise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swear to you, big brother.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will become stronger than anyone
else, so my beloved brother can
keep his promise to me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thank you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big bro, you have to
keep your promise!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
You too, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah!

I've never seen your face before.
Are you from Fitzgald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
My name is <Stahn>. I'm from
the village of Lienea.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chatty Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well, well they call me, Chatty
Old Man. Nice to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The... Chatty Old Man...?
Well, it's nice to meet you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Chatty Old Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. The opportunity to meet
someone for the first time is a
once in a lifetime event, which
must be cherished.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't get it...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
He means, don't mess up your first
impression when you meet someone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohh... I get it!
Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas

You know, it's been a while
since you've helped me out.
How about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Yeah
No
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
All right. I'll leave the
sheep to you, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, you still have something
you must do, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wheeeee!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whatcha got there, Jonathan?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if I used a bow, I wouldn't be
able to hit something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Even if I used a bow, I wouldn't be
able to hit something like that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it's about bows, I'm the
girl you need to know!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Who's this little lady?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>'s really good
with a bow, Gramps!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Really? Then I have
a favor to ask.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
There's something caught in the
tree just outside the house.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
If you were to hit a spot close
enough to it with an arrow, I
reckon it'd fall out.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I understand.
I think I can do that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
There must be something
we can do to help...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry,
Miss <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be right back.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that was fast. Are
you done already?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. What's done
is done, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wh-What is THAT?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's an egg!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
This is what was 
stuck in the tree?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yep.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It hatched!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eee! It's so cuuute!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's... Kind of creepy...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the?
Why me!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chelsea>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, that's not fair, Miss <Lilith>!
I'm the one who found it! Boo!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Does it think <Lilith>
is its mother?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like you've got someone
to take care of, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehh!? My brother's enough
work for one girl!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, take
it for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, take
it for a walk.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
How'd it go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Pretty well, actually.
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
That's good, but what should
we do with it now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandpa, could I ask you to
take care of it for a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
You still want to
travel with <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mhm. I'll be sad to part
with this little girl, but..
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I reckon I can consider this cute
little fellow my third grandchild.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you on about, grandpa? If
anything, it's your great-grandchild!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Hohohoh, I reckon you're right;
it's your foster-child, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, grandpa. Where's
the baby dragon?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no idea
where it went...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
What!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to go
look for it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did it leave
by itself?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, it did. I'm
sorry, <Lilith>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Was it getting big?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. It had gotten much, much
bigger than when it was born.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I guess it had to leave
the nest someday...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sad that I won't be able
to see her anymore, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a mother, I should
be happy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's the spirit,
<Lilith>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's still too early for
you to leave the nest
though, big bro.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Next time we see her, maybe
she'll bring her own kids!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
In that case, I wouldn't
be able to take care of
them and you two at
the same time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Give me a break...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hehehe!
[ENDBLOCK]
Thomas
[ENDBLOCK]
Hohohoh!<x00>
