[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome to Heidelberg Castle!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
<Darzen>, His Excellency
told me about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Welcome back, Your Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the audience hall.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
All we can do is to protect
this castle and the city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We believe in your victory,
Your Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no one in this castle who
does not know your face.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no one in this castle 
who does not know your faces.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish His Majesty the 
best of luck in this war.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish you the best of luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems that the day of true
peace is still far away.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Until true peace is restored,
we too will not complain.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The castle was damaged in
the <Greybum> rebellion, but
it has finally been restored.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, please 
take care of yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
The restoration of the relations
with Cyril is progressing smoothly,
and His Majesty's life has a bright
future ahead of him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought this would happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You are the pride of our kingdom,
the kingdom itself!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
I was going to make you fall 
in love with me with my beauty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't get close to His Majesty
because there's a strange little
boy hanging around!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Your Majesty! You're in
a good mood. What's with the
little guy?
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, Your Majesty! You're in
a good mood. What's with the
little guy?
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't get close to His Majesty
because there's a strange little
boy hanging around!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, that's scary. It's nothing.
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
You look too serious, so I'll
stop joking around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish I could be there 
for you, Your Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, we will celebrate
your safe return!
[ENDBLOCK]
Catgirl
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll have a big celebration once
everyone's back safe and sound!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
An ambush?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I warned you to get out of
this country. Why did you 
come here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because I need to ask you something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And I didn't know you were
working with <Woodrow> Kelvin.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is only one answer
to this question.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Stop it, Mr. <Dalis>! <Mary> told 
me about you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will listen to no more,
prepare yourselves!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why? ...Why must we 
cross blades.!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>... Your beauty hasn't
changed in two years.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You fool...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>, are you aware of what
<Greybum> is planning to do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, I am.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then why!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, don't get excited.
Let <Mary> do the talking.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right. 
...Sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>, what are you doing!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Could he be...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>, no!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, please step aside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
To your feet, <Dalis> Vincent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm ready. I will take whatever
fate I am deserving of.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>! Please stop!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
You can't stay here any longer.
Hurry and escape the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, heal your wounds. Then come 
back and visit me later.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you think you are doing?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will not refuse to talk with you.
I will take a different
path from my father.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let us fight to the end, to decide 
the path this country will take.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not with blades, but with words.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The son of Isaac the Wise, is even
more wise than his father. 
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've... lost.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>... <Dalis>!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not leaving.
I'll never leave you again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis> wasn't really following
<Greybum>, was he.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can only assume his name 
was used for recruitment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
How underhanded of them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>! I'll never forgive you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, I need to ask a favor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to go with...
I want to be with <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, but this is where...
I'm... home now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to be a warrior,
I want to be a wife to <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. Go ahead, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. It would be foolish to
say no when you're that sappy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I wish you happiness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this OK, Master <Lion>?
She's a criminal, after all, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hmph. I'll be sure to report this.
That she was injured, and we had
no choice but to abandon her.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, everyone...
I'm so lucky...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for sparing <Dalis>'
life, I appreciate it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I should be the one thanking you.
Thanks to you, I'm more prepared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
More prepared?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
One must be aware of their position
and responsibility, as well as being 
prepared to take on everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
In order to do that, we must 
defeat <Greybum>, first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, let's go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, please be safe!
I believe you will be victorious!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
