[ENDBLOCK]
Hi, it's been a long time!
How was Seinegald?
[ENDBLOCK]
<IGNORE>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think you may have mistaken 
me for someone else.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't go away. Come on,
let's talk about it again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you really a different person?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, sorry about that.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
As you've realized your mistake.
Don't worry about it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do I really look that much like
the person you had met before?
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
If one of his acquaintances sees
you...that would be an interesting
reaction.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
He seemed to be in a rush, so it 
will be impossible to find him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right! Then you should find 
somebody who might know him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Traveler
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure they'll mistake 
you for him.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So claire is a child if
she doesn't know.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll do this, so don't
come anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, isn't that little
red-haired boy?
[ENDBLOCK]
Worker
[ENDBLOCK]
She was a cute girl, so I would
have liked to see her again.

<TAG_005>A delicious looking cake.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma
[ENDBLOCK]
My son-in-law doesn't understand
how happy I am to live
in the capital.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma
[ENDBLOCK]
If this happens, it might be
better to escape to Armeida.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that not only Seinegald,
but also other countries
are under attack.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma
[ENDBLOCK]
I decided not to run to Armeida.
If I'm going to die, I want
to live in this city.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma
[ENDBLOCK]
We took all the lens we had at home
with us to the Castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
Grandma
[ENDBLOCK]
Please help us.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I really want to live in Armeida,
but my family doesn't want
to leave the capital.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I think we sould evacuate to Armedia
before Darilsheid gets attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
My mother-in-law insisted she
didn't want to, so the idea
of ecacuating to Armeida disappeared.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Nowadays, it's probably the same
wherever you are...
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I saw the Integrated Lens Cannon
in the Castle.
Promising, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Finally realized how wonderful
the sunlight was.
[ENDBLOCK]
Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't care where I live,
as long as I'm with my family.
[ENDBLOCK]
Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Dad and Grandma are
giving up too much.
[ENDBLOCK]
Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
Why can't people think of
anything but bad things?
[ENDBLOCK]
Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
If you give up on anything,
that's the end of it.
[ENDBLOCK]
Daughter
[ENDBLOCK]
So, don't ever give up.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
