Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I've recently found myself
coming here more often lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Perhaps it's because here I can forget
how bad things are at the moment, and
go back to my childhood days.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I kinda feel you there, pal.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
But for me, there's nothin' but
bad memories up in these seats...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well now, didn't expect
him to say that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is this what you were talking about
before, about the champion you idolized?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cripes..I can't win
with you, <Stahn>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
You idolized a former
champion, <Kongman>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I fight with my fists
only because I'm an imitation
of that champion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. I was very,
very poor as a child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was a place where nobody'd
bat an eye if someone dropped
dead in front of them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
And yet, my admiration for that
champion is what kept me going,
what gave me life.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, that's what I tell everyone,
at least. Truth is, I never cared
for 'em at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y'see, that champion's
matches were all fixed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cheating?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. It was by chance, but
I saw it with my own eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
It absolutely broke my heart... 
but I made a vow right then,
right there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I swore, I would become the champion,
that I would be a true hero for all children.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
In a way, you might say what made
me what I am today was my sheer
hatred for that false Champion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
And so, though you might say
I'm wrong, this is my belief.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whether they admire me or hate me,
it's fine. As long as... the kids survive.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
So long as you live to become an adult,
I believe you always have a shot.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I think you're right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoops, didn't mean to bore
you with that sob story.
Let's get outta here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I've recently found myself
coming here more often lately.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's as if some unseen hand
is bringing me to...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you from Calvalese?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you
talking about...?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it you want?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The truth is...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I married a wealthy man in
this city, and now look at me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't let this happiness
pass me by, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry about that. If it's too much
trouble, we can leave you alone.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
That' s not it. The old me would have
helped you under any circumstance...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just a little shocked
at how much I've changed...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's inevitable, we all change
little by little. At least,
that's what I think.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
...Thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't help you much, but you
can at least take this with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, by the way, there's another
hidden Calvalese in town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, good luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, by the way, there's another
hidden Calvalese in town.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, good luck.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I always bet on <Kongman>. 
Part of the reason I've never lost.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
If <Kongman> leaves,
who will I bet on!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no good fighters
competing these days.
[ENDBLOCK]
Man
[ENDBLOCK]
I will never forget the
heroic deeds of Mighty.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> is so strong! He's the
greatest champion of all time.
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
Champion, what do you mean
you're taking a break for a while?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
So, you're saying that the champion is
working to resolve the current crisis?
[ENDBLOCK]
Young Man
[ENDBLOCK]
It's amazing that the champion
can help save the world!
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I think it's time for the champion's
title to change hands.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
In <Kongman>'s absence, now's
the time for the new generation
of fighter to flourish...
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it weird that I'm in the arena
while the world is in crisis?
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't wait for world to go
back to normal and enjoy
the arena like I used to.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well it's not like I'm doing
anything different though.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's the famous arena!
The atmosphere was so
intense during the matches.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't think the absence of
the champion will change the
enthusiasm around here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
This arena looks sturdy, so if
something falls from the sky,
it would be safe, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
The people gathered here
are just trying to escape
from the grim reality.
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
I heard that the heroes who're
trying to save the world are
flying around on a dragon!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Sailor
[ENDBLOCK]
...What? You're saying it's 
you guys, Ha ha ha, good one!
[ENDBLOCK]
Announcer
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, our challenger approaches!
[ENDBLOCK]
A daredevil has appeared to
challenge Mighty <Kongman>!
[ENDBLOCK]
Spectators
[ENDBLOCK]
Mighty! Mighty! Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I must praise you for not running
away. Have you prepared yourself?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I still don't really get
why we have to fight.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>, please watch me. 
I will devote the glory 
of my victory to you!
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, in this very moment, witness
this very special match!
[ENDBLOCK]
Champion <Kongman>！
VS!	Mr. Pointy Head!
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh my! We've reached an 
unexpected conclusion! The
challenger has won the match!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gwah... This is ridiculous.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
How was that? Do you get it now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't cling to <Philia> 
anymore, okay? And...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was a good match. Thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Y-you... you're a pretty
refreshing guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
What's this? The formation of a
friendship between these two? What a 
strange, but touching honor this is!
[ENDBLOCK]
The champion is the winner!
That's what I'm talking about!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gahahahaha! You're afraid!
I can't even hear you anymore!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>...I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You...seem to be close to her.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Hmm, it was a good match.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>...
[ENDBLOCK]
What's this? The formation of a
friendship between these two? What a 
strange, but touching honor this is!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you all doing in
a place like this?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>? You just
missed the match!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're really playing around in here?
Monsters are attacking the town!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did you say?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What did you say?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn, what the hell
is going on!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's hurry and get out of here too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm the Champion!
Gahahahaha!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
