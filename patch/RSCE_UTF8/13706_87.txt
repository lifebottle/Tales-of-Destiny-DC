Do whatever it takes to regain
the Eye of Atamoni. I'm counting
on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for your efforts.
I'll see you upon your return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, <Lion>.

[ENDBLOCK]
Do whatever it takes to regain
the Eye of Atamoni. I'm counting

[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't forget, getting the Eye of 
Atamoni back is the first priority.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>... have you been 
deceiving me all this time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian Masters, save Cresta.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, I know you are tired,
but please go see <Reynolds>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We will do everything in our power
to support your actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've arranged for you to stay at the
inn. Do get some rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've done all we can do.
It's up to you now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must not, by any chance, fail
His Majesty's expectations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cresta is a city east 
of the royal capital.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you reach the city, look
for our resident soldiers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must not, by any chance, fail
His Majesty's expectations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only the seven generals
had been here, this would
not have happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that I think about it, the 
deployment of the seven generals
was also <Hugo>'s idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of <Hugo>, I regretfully made
myself an enemy of my country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll send military help immediately.
I need you to hold out until then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> wants to talk to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The entrance to the laboratory is 
in the courtyard of the castle.
Be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are sending out requests to 
every city in the country 
and collecting lenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm very sorry for asking 
so much of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The operation is scheduled to take
place tomorrow morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe you will be victorious, 
Swordian masters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the audience room.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Now everyone, hurry to 
the courtyard.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Please proceed to His Majesty's.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
The ship I arranged, will be 
docked at Darilsheid port.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful out there, <Mary>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of <Mary> 
for me, <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
You take care of her, and let 
me worry about Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Heavenly King <Miktran>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right. He was the ruler of the 
Heavenly Realm, and is behind
the current turmoil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> took the Eye of Atamoni?
And <Hugo> is the one that attacked
the earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The sky was also covered with a
shell. <Greybum>'s rebellion in the
first place...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean this was all a 
part of <Miktran>'s plan?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Ancient Heavenly King...
What kind of person was he?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I had to describe it in one word.
Overwhelming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Intimidation like a storm blowing from
his entire body. With it. the ability to 
control <Belserius> with ease.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everything was off the charts.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was all we could do to escape.
That was too bad for them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only I had been able to recapture 
the Eye of Atamoni at least...
I am painfully aware of my 
helplessness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it is rather our country that 
needs to be held accountable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is because we failed to see 
<Hugo> for what he was and our trust
of him that brought us here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Instead of dwelling on the past
think about what is yet to come.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
As it happens, the leaders of
the three nations are all here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should immediately establish a 
system among nations and come up
with countermeasures.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Forces on Earth versus the Forces
in Heaven. It's truly a war between 
heaven and earth.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would like to hear from you, Swordian
Masters, if you have any ideas.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll go up again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not just once, but many times if 
we have to. We will not give up 
until we defeat <Miktran>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, <Dymlos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, that's right...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hi, everyone...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're hurt?
What's happened?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry, folks...
Radisrol has fallen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We tried our best to hold on,
but they ultimately overan us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't even use the weightless 
elevator anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened to <Ritora>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The commander is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We need to get you patched up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If Radisrol is lost, there's no 
way for us to get up there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Please permit me to speak!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's going on?
[ENDBLOCK]
Cresta troops requesting
assistance!
[ENDBLOCK]
A horde of monsters has descended
from the sky, we're under attack!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cresta?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not only do you cast us into darkness,
you want to kill us all too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did he deliberately target a place
where defenses are weak?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why! Stop it, you've got
to be kidding me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't stay like this.
We have to go back now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not enough. I will send a relief
force of my own immediately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't trust that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait for me, <Rutee>!
I'm coming with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No... all of us, too,
I guess.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The situation seems to be imminent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's better if we head out there, 
where we can move quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...All right. I leave it to you.
We'll dispatch a rescue team 
as soon as it's ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm coming with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you need a more help
right now. Even if I'm like this, 
I can add to your strength.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
And isn't it weird that Aquaveil's 
representative isn't on the team?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've already discussed it.
Please don't hesitate to use me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, that's very helpful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, we should head to
Cresta right away.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you're okay. I was 
worried about you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, you are looking well too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>, I wasn't expecting you.
What's going on in our country?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The monsters that have attacked 
various parts of the country have 
all been contained so far.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay. I'm relieved to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came here because I was asked to 
make a delivery to Sir <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
You remember the dragon that attacked
the castle during the last <Greybum> 
revolt, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I took that dragon, modified it, made
it rideable. That's the delivery.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What a...
When did that happen?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems to be structurally the
same as the Draconis. They can't 
gain much altitude, though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Please make use of it.
I trust Your Majesty will do well."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...... and this message
from Sir <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's parked outside the city right now.
You can go and see for yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Okay. I'll use it
thankfully.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we can travel with that dragon, 
it's the most efficient thing we can do.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think we can get straight to
the Swordian Institute.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like the wind is 
changing, isn't it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's usually when the
luck comes around.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of <Mary>.
I want you to let me worry 
about the Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>. I haven't forgotten 
what you said to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
So come back safely to...
To our homeland, Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I promise you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, everyone of the Swordian team.
Do you have a plan?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, go to the Swordian Institute
to strengthen your forces.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that, we will go to Junkland
and get the bell cerium.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the meantime, I will be working on
the Lens Cannon in the courtyard
of the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are also planning to procure lenses
at the same time with the help of His 
Excellency <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are already calling on all towns
and villages in the country to offer
their lenses.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand. My country will do 
everything in our power to support
your actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel bad that I can't do anything
myself, but I will spare no effort
to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, team.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay. Then we'll head to 
the Swordian Institute!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone of the Swordian team.
Thank you for all your hard work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Len Cannon was completed,
and everything seemed to finally
be ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll launch the operation
tomorrow morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tomorrow...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tomorrow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I would like you all 
to get a good night's rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've arranged for you to stay at the
inn. Do get some rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know you really want to go
back to your homeland. We don't
have time. I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, sir. Thank you for your concern.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, let's get to the city first. 
I'm afraid to stand in front of
the throne and talk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, <Lion>. It took you long enough.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The king has already gone to bed.
So, how did the investigation go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. We have indeed found an 
unidentified, yet powerful monster.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Then let's quickly 
send in the troops.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that won't be necessary.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I've wiped out all the monsters
that were in the vicinity.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, all on your own.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it's because of <Chaltier>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. That's right. That's what 
you call a Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be sure to report to His 
Majesty on your excellent work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel really embarrassed 
when he person praises us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier> is also pleased.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
And then, <Lion>. Do you know 
why such a monster appeared?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All the monsters appeared 
from the ocean.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe something happened at 
the bottom of the ocean.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. I'll have them look into it.
Thanks for your help, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'll take my leave.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a minute, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, sir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have a gathering of the 
Seven Generals coming up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're a visiting swordsman, you 
won't have much to do with the 
people on the inside.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once again, I want to introduce
you to everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you want
me to be there?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can I take that response as approval?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. It's late today.
Let's talk about it tomorrow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, if you'll excuse me.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick

<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
陛下、七将軍ここに、
そろいました。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
うむ。何ヶ月ぶりであろうな。
こうして皆が揃ったのは。
[ENDBLOCK]
リーン
[ENDBLOCK]
で、陛下？
今回はなんの用だったんだ？
[ENDBLOCK]
ルウェイン
[ENDBLOCK]
リーンよ、陛下に
なんという口ぶりです。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
はっはっは。気にせずともよい。
リーンよ、相変わらずだな。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
陛下。そうやってリーンを
甘やかすのは、どうかと思いますが。
[ENDBLOCK]
リーン
[ENDBLOCK]
お～、<Melina>ちゃん。
陛下に意見とは、おまえもやるねえ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
バカな！	そのようなものでは……！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
ほらほら、止めようよ。
きっとリーンは<Melina>の事が、
好きなんだよ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
だから、そうやって
つっかかるんだよ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
止めてくれ。
こいつに愛されるなど、ゾッとする。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
だが、世間の女たちは、
こいつに愛されたいのだろ？
[ENDBLOCK]
リーン
[ENDBLOCK]
よく言った<Ascus>君。
ん～～、偉い！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
これ、おまえたち陛下の御前だぞ。
いいかげんにしないか。
[ENDBLOCK]
ルウェイン
[ENDBLOCK]
して、陛下。リーンもお聞きしましたが、
なぜ、我らを招集したのでございますか？
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
特に理由がないとまずいか？
[ENDBLOCK]
ルウェイン
[ENDBLOCK]
いえ、そのような……
[ENDBLOCK]
リーン
[ENDBLOCK]
ダメェ～。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
こら、リーン！
ほら、<Ascus>も何か言ってよ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
俺も、そんなに暇では
ないのですが。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
んもう、<Ascus>まで！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
まあまあ、<Melina>も
落ち着いて。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
はっはっは！	そうだったな。
君たちの立場も考えるべきだな。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
それでは、次も諸君らが、
急がしい時に召集するとしよう。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
陛下まで……
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
すまなかったな、
解散してくれ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
このような世界に
なってしまうとは……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
絶対に、俺たちが
なんとかしてみせます。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
いや、違うのだ……
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
余に、世継がおらん事を、
憂いておるのだ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
世継……？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
後を継ぐ人の事、
つまり陛下の後継者だよ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
諸君らが、元の世界を
取り戻してくれる事は信じておる……
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
しかし、再び、余自身の目で、
平和なこの国を見られるかは、分からぬ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
やはり、彼に……
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
誰か！	<Queen>と<Ashley>を、
ここに呼んでまいれ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>、ただ今参上しました。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
うむ、呼び出して
すまなかったな。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>。ここに来てもらったのは、
他でもない。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>とは、前々より、
話しておったのだが……
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
単刀直入に申す。余たちの
息子になってはくれぬか？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
それはいったい……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
私たち夫婦には子供がおりません。
ですから……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
本当に……私などで良いのですか？
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
もちろんじゃ、元々は
<Finlay>に話しておった事じゃからな。
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Finlay>の弟であれば、
申し分ない。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S12>……また兄さんか……
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
何か申したか？
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
どうじゃ、<Ashley>よ？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S12>……僕は……代わりじゃない……
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
さあ、返事を聞かせてくれ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
申し訳ありません、陛下。
このお話、お断りさせて頂きます。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
どうしてなの、<Ashley>！

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
……失礼します。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>……
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
このような世界に
なってしまうとは。
あやつの兄がいてくれれば……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
あやつの冷めた内にある、
炎のような強い意志に期待して
おったのだがな……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>さん、一体、
誰の事なんですか？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>の事だ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>さんって、
お兄ちゃんのお友達でしょ？
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
ああ、うん……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>は食えん男だったが……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
私は、<Lion>は買っておったのだ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
それが、こんな事をしおって！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
俺はてっきり、<Dryden>さんは
<Lion>を嫌っていると思ってました。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
そんな事はない。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
あやつが、もう少し成長した時、
それは、私が引退する時だと思っておった。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>には、新たな七将軍を
務めてもらうつもりでいたのだ。
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>がですか!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
ああ。しかし、それも今では
夢と消えてしまった……
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
あやつの冷めた内にある、
炎のような強い意志に期待して
おったのだがな……<x00>
