You must do whatever it takes
to regain the Eye of Atamoni.
I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for your efforts.
I'll see you upon your return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I'm counting on you to

[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must head to Straylize
Temple as soon as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must do whatever it takes
to regain the Eye of Atamoni.
I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Getting the Eye of Atamoni back is
our first priority. Don't forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>... have you been
deceiving me all this time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian Masters, save Cresta.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, I know you are tired,
but please go see <Reynolds>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our country will do everything in
our power to support your actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've arranged for you to stay at the
town's inn. I hope you get some rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've done all we can do.
It's up to you now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must not, by any chance, fail
to meet His Majesty's expectations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cresta is a city east
of the royal capital.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you reach the city, look for
the soldiers we have stationed there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must not, by any chance, fail
to meet His Majesty's expectations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only the Seven Generals
had been here, this would
not have happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that I think about it, the
deployment of the Seven Generals
was also <Hugo>'s idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of <Hugo>, I regretfully made
myself an enemy of my country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll send military help immediately.
I need you to hold out until then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> wants to talk to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The entrance to the laboratory is
in the courtyard of the castle.
Be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are sending out requests to
every city in the country
and collecting lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm very sorry for asking
so much of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The operation is scheduled to take
place tomorrow morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe you will be victorious,
Swordian masters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the audience chamber.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, make haste
to the courtyard.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Please proceed to His
Majesty's throne.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
The ship I arranged will be
docked at Darilsheid port.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be careful out there, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of <Mary>
for me, <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
You take care of her, and let
me worry about Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Aetherian King, <Miktran>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes. He is the self-appointed ruler
of the Aetherians, and the one solely
responsible for this crisis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>'s theft of the Eye of Atamoni...
and <Hugo>'s assault upon the earth...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The outer shell hiding the sky...
Even <Greybum>'s rebellion...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean to say that these events
were all part of <Miktran>'s plan?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell me more of this Aetherian King.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
In a single word - overwhelming.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
An aura of unimaginable force
radiated fom him. He was able to
control <Belserius> with ease.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've never seen anything like it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
All we could do was run.
He was just too strong.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only we had been able to
recover the Eye...
I have never felt so incompetent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are not to blame. Our country
needs to be held accountable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our failure to see <Hugo> for what
he truly was and our blind trust in
him is what has brought us here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
Instead of dwelling on the past
think about what is yet to come.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
By some twist of fate, the leaders
of the three countries are present.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should establish an alliance
among our nations and come up
with countermeasures.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Another Aeth'er War...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you have any recommendations for
a course of action, Swordian Masters,
I would like to hear them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll go up again.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Many times if we have to. We will
not give up until we defeat <Miktran>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, <Dymlos>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, that's right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
E-Everyone...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're all beat up.
What happened?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, but Radisrol has fallen...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We tried our best, but they
ultimately overwhelmed us...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't even use the
zero-gravity elevator anymore.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
What happened to <Ritora>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The commander is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Get him patched up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
If Radrisol is truly lost,
we have no means to return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way...!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Pardon the intrusion.
It's an emergency!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it now!?
[ENDBLOCK]
The troops stationed at Cresta
are requesting assistance!
[ENDBLOCK]
A horde of monsters has descended
from the sky. They're under attack!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cresta?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Miktran>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not only does he cast us into darkness,
he wants to eradicate us as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did he deliberately target a place
where defenses are weak?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way... You've got
to be kidding me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I need to do something.
I have to go back now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You alone are no match for the horde.
I'll start preparing a relief force immediately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't trust they'll get there in time!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait, <Rutee>!
I'm coming with you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not just me... but all of us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
The current situation is dire.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It would be better for us to handle it.
We are able to mobilize quickly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Very well. I leave it to you.
We'll dispatch our forces as
soon as they're ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm coming with you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
You need all the help you can get.
Though it may be lacking, I will
lend you my strength.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Besides, we can't have a proper
team without representation
from Aquaveil, could we?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Fayte>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've already discussed it.
Please don't hesitate to call upon me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, that's very helpful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Alright. Let's hurry over to Cresta!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm glad you're okay.
I was worried.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're looking well too, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>, I wasn't expecting you.
What's going on in our country?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have been able to hold back
the monster raids across our lands.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... I'm relieved to hear that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came here because I was asked to
make a delivery for Sir <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you remember the dragon that
attacked the castle during the
last <Greybum> revolt?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We were able to modify the dragon
and make it rideable. That's the delivery.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Amazing...
How is that possible?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems to be structurally the
same as the Draconis. It can't
gain much altitude, however.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
"Please use it as you see fit. I trust
Your Majesty will use it wisely."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is the message
from Sir <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's currently parked outside the
city. You should see it for yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I understand. I'll put it to good use.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
This dragon should make traveling
more efficient.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
We might be able to use it to
travel to the Swordian R&D Lab.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel like the winds of
fate are beginning to change.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's usually when the
luck comes around.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, <Dalis>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please take care of <Mary>.
Leave Phandaria to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I haven't forgotten what you
said to me, <Woodrow>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
So come back safely...
Safely to our homeland, Phandaria.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I promise you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian Team. Does this mean
we have a plan of action?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
First, we travel to the Swordian
R&D Lab to bolster our strength.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
After that, we will go to Junkland
and get the Berselium.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the meantime, I will be working on
the Integrated Lens Cannon in
the courtyard of the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
With the help of His Excellency <Dryden>,
arrangements are being made to
assist us in procuring lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are already calling on all towns
and villages in the country to offer
their lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand. My country will do
everything in our power to support
your actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel bad that I can't do anything
myself, but I will spare no effort
to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay. Then we'll head to
the Swordian R&D Lab!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone of the Swordian team.
Thank you for all your hard work.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Integrated Lens Cannon is complete.
At long last, we are ready to strike back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll launch the operation
tomorrow morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tomorrow...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tomorrow!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I would like you all
to get a good night's rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've arranged for you to stay at the
town's inn. I hope you get some rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I know you really want to go
back to your homeland. We don't
have time. I'm sorry.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, sir. Thank you for your concern.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, let's head into the city for now.
Flapping our gums in front of the
throne is discourteous.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, Sir <Lion>.
You've finally returned.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The King has already gone to bed.
So, how did the investigation go?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was able to confirm the existence
of some powerful, unidentified monsters.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Then I will send in
the troops at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that won't be necessary.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe I've wiped out all the monsters
that were in the area.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, now, all on
your own, hm?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, I had <Chaltier> to assist me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmh, I see. As expected
of a Swordian, I suppose.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll be sure to report your excellent
work to His Majesty on your behalf.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
I feel kind of embarrassed
when <Dryden> praises us...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>'s very pleased as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Moving on, Sir <Lion>. Have you any
idea as to where the monsters came from?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
All of them came
out of the ocean.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe something happened at
the bottom of the ocean.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. I will have
this matter investigated.
Thank you for your help, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then,
I'll take my leave.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
One moment, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, sir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Soon, the Seven Generals
are having a conference. Well?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Well, what, sir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a Hedge Knight, your involvement
in the inner affairs of the castle
have been limited thus far.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I would like to introduce
you to the other Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure you want
me to be there?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Should I take that
response as approval?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, absolutely, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. It's getting late.
Let's continue this discussion tomorrow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well.
I'll be going now.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani>
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles.
The first is to [Set your title and
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,
and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!

<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, I present to
you the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been months since last we've
had you all gather like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, Your Majesty?
What do you want this time!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>, how dare you speak to
His Majesty in such a way?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha. Pay it no mind.
<Leen>, you haven't changed at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, perhaps you
shouldn't spoil <Leen> so.
[ENDBLOCK]
Leen
[ENDBLOCK]
Well look at you, Miss <Melina>.
Making a power grab, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Idiot! That's not what I-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, you two, calm down.
It's clear <Leen> likes <Melina>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why he's
always picking on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cut it out!
The very idea of it
gives me the creeps!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought it was the dream
of women everywhere
for <Leen> to fall for them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, <Ascus>!
Well said, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are in the presence
of the King! Behave yourselves!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, Your Majesty, as <Leen>
also asked, what's the reason
you called us all together like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it wrong of me
to not have a reason?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not
what I meant!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone's in trouble~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Leen>!
Say something, <Ascus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm pretty busy, myself.
If there's no reason, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the Goddess, even <Ascus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Calm down, <Melina>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha! You are correct. I should
have considered that from the start.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I shall call for
you all again at another,
less busy occasion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
My apologies.
You are dismissed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought the world
would turn out like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll take care of it, I promise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's not it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am grieved that I have no heir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heir...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty's successor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no doubt that you will restore
the world to its former glory...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, I don't know if I will ever
be able to see this peaceful country
again with my own eyes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
As expected, he...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Somebody! Get the <Queen>
and <Ashley> down here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>, reporting for duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize for summoning you here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>, you have been called here
today for a singular purpose.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Queen> and I have been speaking
on this matter for quite some time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me be blunt.
Will you become my heir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
My husband and were not blessed
with any children. Therefore...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
A-Are you sure this is a good idea?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Without a doubt. I had originally
offered this to <Finlay>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are truly <Finlay>'s little brother,
it is the only obvious choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S12>(...yet again, my brother...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, <Ashley>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S12>(...I...am not a substitute...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, let's hear your answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I'm afraid
I must decline your offer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that, <Ashley>?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you'll excuse me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought the world would
turn out like this. If only his brother
were here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was hoping to see the fire in
his cold, strong will.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>, who are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, he's a friend of
my brother's, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, yeah.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> was an insatiable man, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had high hopes for <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
But now, he's dead!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I always thought that you
loathed <Lion>, Mr. <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had thought I would be able to retire
once he had matured a little more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We had planned to have <Lion>
serve as the new Seventh General.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> as a general!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
But that dream has all but faded...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was hoping to see the fire in
his cold, strong will.<x00>
