<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The color of your complexion is
worrisome... I suppose that's to be
expected after everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
How about taking a short rest?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, you're probably right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How are <Dalis>' wounds?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He has no problems in his daily
life. However, it will take some
time before he can return to
his previous level of fitness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. I hope he feels better soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Nnngh.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Has he been calling your
name in his sleep, <Mary>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>... You should be
ashamed of yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...♪
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ma-<Mary>...
That outfit...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cute, isn't it.
I have many more with me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've always wanted to live
surrounded by cute things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My dream has finally come true!
Isn't that great, <Dalis>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right!
You can wear this, <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I-I don't know...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be shy.
You'll look great.♪
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...St-stop that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S07>A-a-aaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't <Lion>!
You look like you're doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph.
You seem like you're living well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am. I have you to thank.
After all you let me go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My life has become very peaceful
living here with <Dalis.>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Speaking of <Dalis>,
where is he now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He recently set out to
the northern guard tower.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's undergoing medical treatment
at the Frostheim hot springs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Little by little his
condition is improving.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good. That's the
most important thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've come all this way.
You should stay for dinner tonight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I make one mean
Beast Meat Poelee, you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, you are welcome
to stay the night if it gets late.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no need.
I won't be staying long.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a job to do.
I don't have time for a long visit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see... That's a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, I must be off.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be a stranger.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure <Dalis> would love
to host you soon.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005><center>You find a love letter in the

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_005>Dear Mr. <Dalis>,
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
					Your secret admirer
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leader>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's pretend we didn't see this.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>, take care of yourself.
Make sure you come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey guys. Has <Mary>
been helpful?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm feeling much better.
Those hot springs work wonders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Entrust Cyril to me.
I'll keep the people safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll go to the castle and
discuss strategies with <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't afford to have the people
of Cyril continue living in turmoil.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The dragons seem to have been helpful.
I'm sure <Darzen> will be pleased.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, and the rest of you, take care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Woodrow>, be sure to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And <Mary>. I love you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will never forget what
you have done for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I hope that we can be
together again soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no need to rush things.
We have plenty of time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's just take it slow.
Is that okay, <Dalis>?

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani>
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles.
The first is to [Set your title and
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue,
and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
