<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
You don't look so good...
I guess your tired after everything
that's happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why don't you go get some rest?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah, I guess.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
How is <Dalis>'s wounds?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no problems in my 
daily life. However, it will take
some time before I can return 
to my previous level of fitness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. I hope you feel better soon.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thanks.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Ugh, hmmm.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been calling your 
name in my sleep, <Mary>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>... You should be 
ashamed of yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
...♪
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ma-<Mary>...
That outfit is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't it cute?
We're all in this together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've always wanted to live 
surrounded by cute things.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
My dream has finally come true!
Doesn't that make you happy?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes! And <Dalis>.
You can wear this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, no, I'll pass.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't be shy.
You'll look great.♪
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...and stop it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S07>Woohoo!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If it isn't <Lion>!
You look like you're doing well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph. Likewise. 
Looks like you're living well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yeah. It's thanks to you
letting me come back here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've been able to live
peacefully with <Dalis>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
So where is <Dalis> right now?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're looking for him,
he's at the guard tower on
the North side of town.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's been undergoing medical
treatment at the Frostheim
Hot Springs, lately, as well.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
He's getting better,
little by little.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Good. That's the
most important thing.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've come all this way.
You should stay for dinner, tonight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I make one mean
Beast Meat Poele, you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, you are welcome
to stay the night if it gets late.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's not necessary.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have a job to do, as well.
I don't have time for a long visit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...that's a shame.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then,
I need to get going.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sure. Come visit
again, sometime.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure <Dalis> would also be
happy to see you anytime, <Lion>.

[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey guys. Has <Mary>
been helpful?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm feeling much better, thanks
to the hot spring bath.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll take care of Cyril. I'll keep
the people from getting upset.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll go to the castle and
discuss a way out with <Darzen>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
We can't afford to make the people
of Cyril any more uncomfortable
than they already are.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
The dragons seem to have been helpful.
I'm sure <Darzen> will be pleased.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>, and the rest of you, take care.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Woodrow>, be sure to come back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dalis>
[ENDBLOCK]
...And <Mary>. I love you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will never forget what
you have done for me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come back anytime.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no need to panic. 
We have plenty of time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's just take it slow.
It's that right, <Dalis>?

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
