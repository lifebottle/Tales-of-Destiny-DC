[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, it's them again!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
C'mon! We're here to challenge
the champion!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
No show! It's a no show!
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is the new us, after all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are the dark, the Dark Wings.
Brand new champions, YEAH!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hello, everyone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you want my autograph?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Nah. Have you guys stopped
playing heroes yet?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Big people like us can't
stay in one place.
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
I came here to take over
as champion at the arena.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Millie>
[ENDBLOCK]
But there is no champion!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Grid>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hah! I guess he got scared
and ran away! It's only-
[ENDBLOCK]
<John>
[ENDBLOCK]
B-Boss!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>, don't kill him.
Just hurt him a little.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... I...
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha, my cheeks,
they're as red as a
clown's!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... I...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's wrong?
[ENDBLOCK]
Girl
[ENDBLOCK]
Excuse me, <Kongman>. The manager
would like to see you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, gotcha.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then, my dear <Philia>, we
must part for a short while.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If we are not to meet again,
should the loneliness keep
you awake at night...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you but whisper my name, in
your heart, I shall be there with
you, always.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm... okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
(<Philia> still doesn't realize
how I feel about her...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
(How can I make her understand
how much she means to me...?)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even when you expect him
to do it, it's still annoying.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Woaah!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
No way!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh! I never thought there was any
woman out there so enthralled with
<Kongman>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
I-It's not just because
he's the Champion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Say, doesn't she kind 
of look like <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is that right? I don't
really see it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, her face kind
of looks similar.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But <Philia>'s voice
is a little... softer?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Like this? "Oh, <Stahn>..?"
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, well. She's the
spitting image now,
huh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, quick, switch
clothes with <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, please don't be
silly. Look, she doesn't
want to, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aww come on, don't you wanna
see how <Kongman> reacts?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
U-Uhm, I just want to make
<Kongman> like me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ooh, I wonder
what'll happen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sorry to keep ya waiting.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Uhm, <Kongman>... I'm...
so happy to see you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
(What gives? <Philia>'s... happy to
see me? Then... that means...!!)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
(No, no, no. This ain't right.
Gotta be cool. Play hard to
get. Now choke back those
tears and...!)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
D-Don't cozy up to me like that!
Don't make the mistake thinkin'
I'm a big softy all of the time!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
He realized I wasn't
<Philia> right away...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh, guess we underestimated
him, huh <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, it's a little surprising.
<Kongman> saw right through it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I knew he'd figure
it out for sure!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Johnny>
[ENDBLOCK]
Heh, guess you'll have to be a
little nicer to him from now on,
huh, <Philia>?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
I truly envy you, <Philia>...
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't go beyond this point unless
you're ready to fight!
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
The arena is just ahead. Please
proceed once you are ready.
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
The city is being attacked
by monsters!? Erm... But I
can't leave my post...
[ENDBLOCK]
Guard
[ENDBLOCK]
Right now, a lot of people from
the city have evacuated here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't know if I can do this,
but I'm sure going to try.
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
The bed next to me is empty, so you
can go ahead and lose without worry.
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
Monsters in the city? Oh, God.
I'm so sick to my stomach!
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
Ow! Ow! Ow! My knee,
my knee, it hurts!
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, it hurts. My teeth hurt.
I can't move like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
Loser
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll make a comeback once
things calm down a little.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
People who claim they almost
won are usually the ones who
really got thrashed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Arena fights aren't lethal, but I'd hate
for that handsome face of yours to get
scarred. Let me treat your cuts, okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care of the people in
town! I'll be here preparing
for the wounded.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm just glad most of the
townsfolk are safe.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
That man slept through
the whole mess!
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
That patient is faking
his injuries.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to have to take
care of a patient while the 
world is in trouble.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
I think I'll kick him
out of bed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
That patient, I'm sure he'll
be back for something after
the fuss dies down.
[ENDBLOCK]
Nurse
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, champ, you gotta do
something about that guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
Spectators
[ENDBLOCK]
Mighty!	Mighty!	Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
Mighty!	Mighty!	Mighty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Th-They're cheering so loudly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Maybe that <Kongman> guy is
somewhat of a celebrity here?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman> is the hero of Neustadt.
For years, his strength has gone
undefeated.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ilene>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please stop this duel. There's
no meaning in fighting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't back down after
I came all the way here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>If you're going through with this, I won't
let you lose. Are you ready, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Clemente>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center><Stahn> and <Dymlos> have gotten
themselves all fired up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're both on the
same page for once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like it's time. We'll
go sit in the stands.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... Please
don't overdo it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right! Let's go!

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
