[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's <Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
What? Where did you lot
come from!? ...Hm, <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>! Please stop this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
To whom do you think you're
speaking? You've become
quite troublesome, <Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is nowhere 
to run. Give it up!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
That Swordian...! You 
must be <Lion> Magnus.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bastard! You followed me here...!
So that's how it is. I understand
everything now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you babbling about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're not going to let you fill
the world with monsters! Give
back the Eye of Atamoni!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmhmhm...
Ahahahaha...!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Filling the world with monsters, huh?
That wouldn't be half bad, either!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, there is nothing to fear.
Because I'm the one in possession
of the Eye of Atamoni!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's no use, he's going to summon monsters!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have been bestowed with unlimited
power! Come forth, Basilisks!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll do as I please. I think I'll start
by watching you bleed to death!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni is gone...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like <Greybum> ran off
with it while we were fighting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We let him escape... even though
we came all the way here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you, <Greybum>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>Can we still catch up
to him if we hurry?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait up! Let's all go together!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll only slow me down.
I don't need your help!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> has allies, you can't do
this alone. We have to combine 
all of our strength!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're still treating me like 
I'm your friend? I already 
told you, you disgust me!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cut it out, you two! This is
not the time to be arguing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! Look out!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Did we miss one!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you okay, <Stahn>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm fine... Hurry... <Greybum> is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>... you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you just going to leave
him like this? Even after he
saved you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, <Philia>, there's more
coming!! Gimme a hand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ughh! How many more
can there be!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay, looks like this... eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like this is the
last one. Let's go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! Hey! That's my line!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on a minute! Where
did you run off to!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And just why is THAT
guy with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before that, we need to
make sure <Stahn> is okay!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to restore him, or...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...? <Philia>, you sound so
worried! Don't talk like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just get on with it, use
the Panacea Bottle!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Okay!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>! Open 
your eyes, <Stahn>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey... Stop kidding around.
<Stahn>! Wake up, already...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...He's sleeping.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character
parameters that can be set. 
The specific method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, press <Square_ani> to 
change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen will be
[Titles]. Press <Triangle_ani> to pick from
all acquired titles.

[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Titles serve two purposes:
The first is to [affect dialogue 
when talking to NPCs].
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Set a title to have certain NPCs interested
while passing them. When talking with NPCs
multiple times you may get different responses.
Change the title and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to certain NPCs, a [?] will 
appear over the character's head. If this 
happens, set a title that seems to be related
to the dialogue, and try talking to them again.
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose for titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
Notice
[ENDBLOCK]
