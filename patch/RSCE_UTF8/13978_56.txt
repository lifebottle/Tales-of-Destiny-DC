[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's <Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the-! Where the hell did
you come from!? ...Hm, <Philia>！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>! Please stop this!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
To whom do you think you're speaking
to? You've become quite troublesome,
<Philia>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is nowhere to run. Prepare yourself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
That Swordian...!
You must be <Lion> Magnus.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bastard, you followed me here...!
So that's how it is. I understand
everything now.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...What are you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We're not going to let you fill the
world with monsters! Give back
the Eye of Atamoni!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Kukuku... 
Ahahahaha...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Filling the world with monsters, huh?
That wouldn't be half bad, either.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, there is nothing to fear.
Because I'm the one in possession
of the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's no use, he's going to summon monsters!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have been bestowed with unlimited
power! Come, Basilisk!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll do as I please. First,
all of you will be bled to death!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni is gone...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It looks like <Greybum> ran off with
it while we were fighting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We let him escape... even though
we came all the way here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Damn you, <Greybum>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Can we still catch up
to him if we hurry?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>！
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait a sec. Let's all go together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you're there you'll only
be a burden. I don't need you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Greybum> has allies, you can't
do this alone. We have to combine
all of our power!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you still treating me like I'm
your friend? I already told you,
you disgust me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cut it out, you two! This is not
the time to be arguing!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>! Look out!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
Gh? Are there still some left!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>... you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you okay, <Stahn>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm fine... Hurry... <Greybum> is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>... you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you just going to leave him like
this? Even after he saved you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>, <Philia>, there's
reinforcements! Gimme a hand!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ughh!! How long is this gonna be?!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
OK, looks like this..eh?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Looks like this
is the last one. Let's go!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Aah! Hey! That's my line!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on a minute, you!
Where did you run off to!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
And just why is 
THAT guy with you??
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before that, we need to
make sure <Stahn> is ok!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have to restore him, or..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...? <Philia>, you sound so
worried! Don't talk like that..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just get on with it,
use the Panacea Bottle!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
O-Ok!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, <Stahn>! Open your eyes, <Stahn>..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey..stop kidding around,
<Stahn>! Wake up, already..!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, no...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...He's sleeping.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
