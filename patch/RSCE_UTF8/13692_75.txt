<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I'm counting on you to
investigate Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must head to Straylize
Temple as soon as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must do whatever it takes
to regain the Eye of Atamoni.
I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for your efforts.
I'll see you upon your return.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm counting on you, <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, I'm counting on you to
investigate Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must head to Straylize
Temple as soon as possible.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You must do whatever it takes
to regain the Eye of Atamoni.
I'm counting on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Getting the Eye of Atamoni back is
our first priority. Don't forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>... have you been deceiving
me this entire time?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Swordian Masters, save Cresta.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, I know you are tired,
but please go see <Reynolds>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our country will do everything in
our power to support your actions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've arranged for you to stay at the
town's inn. I hope you get some rest.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've done all we can do. It's
up to you now, my friends.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must not, by any chance, fail to
meet His Majesty's expectations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cresta is a city east
of the royal capital.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
When you reach the city, look for the
soldiers we have stationed there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We must not, by any chance, fail to
meet His Majesty's expectations.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
If only the Seven Generals
had been here, this would
not have happened.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now that I think about it, the deployment
of the Seven Generals was also <Hugo>'s
idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of <Hugo>, I regretfully made
myself an enemy of my country.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll send military help immediately.
I need you to hold out until then.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds> wants to talk to you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The entrance to the laboratory is
in the courtyard of the castle.
Be careful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are sending out requests
to every city in the country
and collecting lens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm very sorry for asking
so much of you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The operation is scheduled to
take place tomorrow morning.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe you will be victorious,
Swordian masters.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the audience
chamber.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Everyone, make haste
to the courtyard.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Please proceed to His
Majesty's throne.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
The ship I arranged for you will
be docked at Darilsheid port.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Whoa, how fancy! Is this
Seinegald Castle?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're pretty happy-go-lucky,
aren't you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are in the presence of His
Majesty, the King! All of you,
show some respect!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah~! <Atwight>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>, are you
all right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you know why you've been
brought here as prisoners?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, give <Atwight>
back! She's mine!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Silence!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
To ravage ruins under the king's
control and to attack His Majesty's
soldiers in his lands is inexcusable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
For crimes against the crown,
a severe punishment must be
prepared!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey now...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You there, boy!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oh, yes?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That sword... <Dymlos> was under
the escort of one of our ships.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
So then, why did you have
it in your possession?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... Well, a bunch of 
things happened, and...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't play dumb with me.
That tactic is useless here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
In addition to the disappearance of
the Draconis, you are in possession
of a stolen royal relic.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is bad. At this rate, we're
definitely gonna get convicted!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Eh? That'd be a problem!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait.
[ENDBLOCK]
????
[ENDBLOCK]
Please wait.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it, <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
These people, though imperfect,
wield the Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
They possess unique abilities. I wonder
if we are being too reckless and rash
in their judgement.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...<Hugo>, what are you thinking?)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Judgement must be passed
on these criminals!
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Please permit me to speak!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
What is it!?
[ENDBLOCK]
Some unknown personnel have
attacked Straylize Temple!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Straylize Temple!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What should we do, Your Highness?
This comes as quite a surprise...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is there something about Straylize
Temple that worries you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
In truth, there is an extremely
important relic being hidden in
that temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
These people must be after it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
This relic, could it possibly
be the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Eye of Atamoni!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are <Dymlos> and <Atwight>
so surprised about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who knows?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>... so you knew about it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I was originally involved in 
archaeology, so I can surmise
what it might be, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Just how important is
this Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is said that it's the source of
the great calamity that befell
the world long ago.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've been left with this warning:
"The Eye of Atamoni must never
see the light of day again."
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case, we must
dispatch a team immediately,
under my command.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wait. You may be the General, but
if you thoughtlessly dispatch the
army, it will cause a panic among
our citizens.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then what do you
propose we do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
We should at least consult the
other Seven Generals, but they
are all currently engaged on 
different missions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ehh... Are there no qualified
people available?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Um... well, what if you
sent me to investigate?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...Is this guy an idiot?)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you saying...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
If there's no one else that can
do it, then please let me go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to become a knight
of Seinegald and do great
things, at any cost.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You insolent boy!
Silence, now!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Where do you get off, speaking
to a government official like
that? Know your place!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. It might not be a
completely bad idea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
If I'm not mistaken, the Swordians
were created in the same era as
the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since they're all relics from
ancient times, their abilities
may prove useful to us.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you saying we should let
these criminals run loose?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Wouldn't it be enough to put them
under <Lion>'s supervision? Since
he also uses a Swordian.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(...I see...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that's your
plan, <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You always make sound arguments,
but let's speak plainly. You want
your son to take all the credit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I would never do such a thing.
However, there are no other
candidates for this currently.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
That <Hugo> guy is
<Lion>'s dad, then?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
At the least, it would give
us the ability to keep tabs
on these three.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
As long as they wear that device
<Reynolds> created, we should have
no cause for concern.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. Since this is a
state of emergency, we'll
go with <Hugo>'s plan.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> Magnus!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You will take these people with
you and go to the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If anything threatens the Eye
of Atamoni, do everything in
your power to secure it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary> and I got pulled into
this before we knew it...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll do my best! I look forward to
working with you as a knight!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, Swordian Masters, for
taking the time to gather here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry for this blunder. Truly,
I can't even begin to apologize.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
First of all, please let us know
the details of the situation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Who used the Draconis to
steal the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> Magnus.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Lion>...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Lion> did what?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why we think he's the one
who took the Eye of Atamoni.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...That's absurd.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There's no way <Lion> would
do something like that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Unfortunately, what
<Dryden> says is true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The other day, <Lion> took the
Draconis that was in the castle.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Shortly thereafter, we received a
report that the Eye of Atamoni had
been stolen. There can be no doubt.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>What was <Chaltier> doing?
There was no way he could just
sit back and let that happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Atwight>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's like I'm trapped in
a horrible nightmare...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Around the same time, the President
of Oberon, <Hugo>, also disappeared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We believe the two of them are
colluding with one another.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
So that means Oberon is also involved?
This whole situation is really strange...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have any idea where
the Draconis was headed?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
While we waited for you to assemble, we
used every resource at our disposal to
conduct a thorough search.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
As a result, we have a rough idea
of where to look. It's a small island
northeast of here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
The island was once home
to an Oberon factory.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Even after they shut it down, the
facility remained. There's a good
chance they're hiding in there.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Kongman>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you know that, isn't it best
to just raid the place?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Such a large display of force would
certainly be noticed. If we allow them
to escape, we will lose everything.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
And that's where we come in.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Correct. I would like to request you
all to infiltrate the Oberon factory.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you find the Eye of Atamoni,
I want you to retrieve it at all
costs.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
As far as <Lion> Magnus is concerned,
you may decide what to do with him
when the time comes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
If apprehending him proves to be too
difficult... you may use deadly force.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Philia>
[ENDBLOCK]
That means we may
have to fight <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand that it may be difficult
to fight a former ally.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
But as long as the matter involves the
Eye of Atamoni, it is unavoidable.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
...I refuse to believe this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> is our dearest friend.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
We've been through so much. We
retrieved the Eye of Atamoni
from <Greybum> together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
There is no way that <Lion> would
be anything like <Greybum>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I don't want to assume that <Lion> is
the bad guy and act accordingly!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>You're too naive! This is no
time for sentimentality!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not done talking.
Shut up and listen!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure <Lion> has some
reason for this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
So I'm heading to the Oberon
factory to find out what it is.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Getting the Eye of Atamoni back is
our first priority. Don't forget that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Our ships will take you to the island
where the factory is located.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We have already prepared one for you
at the harbor. We have even provided
you a contingency of soldiers.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You have done a great deed,
reclaiming the Eye of Atamoni!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Furthermore, I would like to
thank His Highness, <Woodrow>,
for delivering the Eye of Atamoni
himself.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's put together a policy
on how to store the Eye of
Atamoni without delay.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. With the combined efforts of
our two countries, we should be able
to create a perfect security protocol.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
We are happy to help.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> Magnus.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
You've completed your mission,
while also looking after these
criminals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is unfortunate that one
was lost. However, you've
done a wonderful job.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you, Your Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Next up. <Stahn> Aileron
and <Rutee> Katrea.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your work was also excellent.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
In light of the safe return of
the Draconis, the two of you 
are free to go.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, <Stahn> Aileron. About your
request to be a knight...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry. I've actually
changed my mind.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dymlos>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you sure about this, <Stahn>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've learned a lot through this trip.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I met a lot of people. I saw many
things and learned a lot, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
But, I still have a lot to learn.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to see more of the world
and meet more people.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
And you can't do that
if you're a knight?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm really sorry. I need to chase
after my own ideals first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Because of that... Now's
not the right time...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...So then, what will you do?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will return to my hometown.
Then I'll think about what to 
do next.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I understand. We'll place the
matter of knighthood on hold.
We can discuss it again once
the time is right.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
A post within the knighthood of my
kingdom is always open for you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, you will return <Dymlos>
to me. That blade is property of
this kingdom.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you return, we will hand him
back to you. Understand?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry for being so
selfish. Thank you!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then... King <Woodrow>,
I would like to begin our
discussion immediately.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Woodrow>
[ENDBLOCK]
Certainly. Let's begin by asking the
Swordians for their opinions on the
matter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Forgive the intrusion,
Your Highness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, Sir <Lion>. What became
of the Eye of Atamoni?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Regarding that, I must apologize
that I have an urgent request to
ask of you, Your Highness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well. Go on.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I will get to the point. The Eye of
Atamoni was stolen away from a 
room within the temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
WHAT!? Curse that <Hugo>! Such
is the result of believing the 
words of a snake.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
As I feared. Regardless of how
talented you are, it was foolish
of me to leave this to a mere
child.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...<Dryden>! Call for General
<Dryden> at once!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Lion>, your role in this is
complete. You are dismissed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, hear what
I have to say!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have no time to listen to
your excuses. We must act
without delay!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Highness, I will not
make excuses. However, 
I also refuse to give up.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's that?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The true culprit was the
High Priest, <Greybum>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He is currently heading for
Calvalese with the Eye of
Atamoni in tow.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Calvalese...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Furthermore, I have in my custody an
eyewitness, one who saw <Greybum> in
the act.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Were you to allow me use of 
a ship, Your Highness, I vow
that I would return the Eye
of Atamoni, without fail!
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
...In that case, very well. I
will have a ship prepared.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, it will require some time
to arrange this. I trust that this
will not be an issue?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you. I swear that Your Majesty
will not regret this decision.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>, you did it!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Seems so...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, I must ask
you something.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, Your Highness?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell me. Is <Hugo>
aware of this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Why do you ask, if I may?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I am the one asking the questions.
Now, answer me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes. He is aware.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
That puts me at ease. However,
why is <Hugo> not with you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's rather irresponsible of him 
to leave this to you, alone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
<center>That's... awful! Just because Master
<Lion> is alone, that doesn't mean-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Chal, hush...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
But...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty! I would ask that
you not judge my character 
behind my back!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
(<Hugo>...!)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, President <Hugo>. Why
hide in the shadows?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
It is my duty as <Lion>'s father to
look after him, even when he fails.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Since he has already informed me
of the situation, a ship has been
prepared for immediate departure.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Oho, that's just like you, <Hugo>.
You've left no detail out at all,
have you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir <Lion>. Like I said, it
would take time for me
to prepare a boat.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be thankful for your loving father.
Now, go! Pursue those who stole
the Eye of Atamoni from us!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...Yes, Your Highness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The moment the ship is ready,
I will immediately depart.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> Magnus, reporting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Mmh.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Today, your mission is to escort
a bishop from Harmentz Village
over to Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ever since the <Greybum> incident, the
temple has remained short-handed.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, you must escort him
to the temple before nightfall.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
To you, this may seem a simple task.
However, understand that it is still
of the utmost importance.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take care, and return safely.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, Your Highness.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
As we have discussed earlier,
you will be accompanied by
two soldiers from my army.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
I am Will. I'm honored to be
working with you, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, Jobs. You should
at least say hello.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey, you. You're younger than me.
Is this really gonna be okay?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs...that's why they say
you'll never be a captain...
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Please excuse him, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm not a sycophant like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, I'm not as shallow as you.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell, man?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Be silent, you two! You are
in the presence of the king!
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
I apologize.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
...As I explained to you two
earlier, I will be promoting
one of you to captain.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
As for which one, Sir <Lion>
will be the judge of that.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're allowing me to decide?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We had a difference of opinion
as to which of these two should
be promoted.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, we agreed that you
could be trusted to make that 
decision.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is the agreement we reached.
Will you take care of it?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
If that's the case,
then I accept.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please forgive us for burdening our
Hedge Knight's shoulders with this
matter.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Once your duty is completed, we will
expect you to nominate one of these
men for promotion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood. That
will be no issue.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs. Will.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
This mission will determine which of
you two will be promoted to Captain.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Dedicate all of your mind,
body, and soul into the
completion of your task!
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood. Leave it to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Roger that!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
So, the mission was completed
without incident.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Well done.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Bishop is an indispensable figure in
the reconstruction of Straylize Temple.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take pride knowing that you have
assisted in laying such a foundation.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Tell us, <Lion>. How did
it go with those two?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Sir. Here is my
report on them.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll start by talking about
each one's personalities.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs prioritizes others over himself.
He is concerned about the safety of
his friends and those he's guarding.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
In my opinion, these qualities
make for a good leader.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will, on the other hand, always
puts the mission first.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
He knows what is expected of
him, as well as what it takes 
to complete the mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This, too, is essential
for any good leader.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm. It sounds like we are on
the same page. Still, Sir <Lion>,
I want to hear your opinion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs or Will? Which one
is more qualified to be
Captain?
[ENDBLOCK]
Select
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs deserves to be Captain
Will deserves to be Captain

[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, if you'll excuse me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll be counting on you
next time, too, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs, I feel, is the ideal
candidate for promotion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, explain your reason
for choosing him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
At first glance, choosing one's
fellow man over their duty seems
counterproductive for a soldier.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Quite the opposite is true. Jobs' focus
on the well-being of his companions is
what brings about success.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I discovered something when
the <Greybum> Incident took
me around the world.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You cannot overcome everything
on your own. It's crucial to have 
reliable companions.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The more powerful the foe, the 
more important it becomes to 
have friends you can trust.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that having more men
like Jobs in the army will have
the greatest benefit.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is just my opinion, but if
I were with Jobs, I would know
he had my back.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm...I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well, Sir <Lion>. Per your
recommendation, Jobs will be
promoted to Captain.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Are you really sure about me?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have a problem
with my decision?
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
No, it ain't that, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about Will. I'm sure
he'll make Captain, someday, too.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, okay. Thank you. I'll be aimin'
to be like you, you know!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph...
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Also, I'm glad to know you
agreed with me, y'know?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Captain Jobs. Your first assignment
has already been decided.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not going to be an easy
one, but I'm sure you're up
to the task.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Yessir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I believe that Will is the right
choice for promotion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Please, explain your reason
for choosing him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
While escorting the Bishop through
the forest, we were ambushed by
a monster.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Before I knew it, I found myself
facing it down alone.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Despite this, he made the right
call to withdraw, knowing that 
fighting would put the Bishop, 
and the mission, at risk.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
This was surely not an
easy decision to make.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
One's emotions can easily get
the better of them, clouding 
their judgment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Will, however, kept his cool.
He acted rationally, even in
the heat of the moment.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It was Will's actions that ultimately
lead to the completion of the mission.
For this, I am proud of him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmmm...I see...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Very well, Sir <Lion>. Per your
recommendation, Will will be
promoted to Captain.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Was I really the right choice...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Do you have a problem
with my decision?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
No, not at all, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't worry about Jobs. He'll make
a great captain someday, I'm sure.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, you're right... Thank 
you very much, Sir <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
I will continue to devote myself
to becoming more like you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmph...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, then, Captain Will. Your
first assignment has already
been decided.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's not going to be an easy
one, but I'm sure you're up
to the task.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> Magnus,
reporting for
duty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Thank you for coming, and for
handling your previous mission
with expertise.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are too kind, my liege.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now then, I shall brief you
on your next mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Early this morning, the soldiers 
stationed at Cresta delivered an
urgent report.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
It stated that an unusual monster
had been sighted in the area.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I would like you
to investigate this sighting.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it a particularly
dangerous monster?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is, as of now, unknown.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Unknown? Is that true?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
To be honest, the report we
received was quite vague,
and difficult to interpret.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fortunately, it doesn't seem that
Cresta has been attacked.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
However, we do require more
specific information before
we can act.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I see. Then I should consider
this to be a scouting mission.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed. I do understand this
may be beneath you, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, Your Majesty, not at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Due to the nature of the mission, I 
won't be able to send any soldiers
with you, this time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, if this monster does show
itself, you are under no obligation to
engage.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That won't be a problem.
I'm not alone, after all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I have <Chaltier>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Master <Lion>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
At any rate, it is imperative that we
understand what is truly going on. It
is requested that you depart at once.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
Leave it to
me.

Your Majesty, I present to
you the Seven Generals.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's been months since last we've
had you all gather like this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, Your Majesty? What
do you want this time!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>, how dare you speak to
His Majesty in such a way?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahahaha. Pay it no mind. <Leen>,
you haven't changed at all.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty, perhaps you
shouldn't spoil <Leen> so.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well look at you, Miss <Melina>.
Making a power grab, are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Idiot! That's not what I-
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, you two, calm down.
It's clear <Leen> likes you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's why he's always
picking on you.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Cut it out! The very idea
of it gives me the creeps!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I thought it was the dream
of women everywhere for
<Leen> to fall for them!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Indeed, <Ascus>!
Well said, sir!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
You are in the presence of
the king! Behave yourselves!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
Anyway, Your Majesty, as <Leen>
also asked, what's the reason you
called us all together like this?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Is it wrong of me to
not have a reason?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lewein>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's not what
I meant!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Leen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Someone's in trouble~!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come on, <Leen>!
Say something, <Ascus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ascus>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm pretty busy, myself. If
there's no reason, then...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Melina>
[ENDBLOCK]
By the Goddess, even <Ascus>!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
Calm down, <Melina>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hahaha! You are correct. I should
have considered that from the start.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Therefore, I shall call for
you all again at another,
less busy occasion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
Your Majesty...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
My apologies. You
are dismissed.
[ENDBLOCK]

would turn out like this.

We'll take care
of it, I promise.
[ENDBLOCK]

[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's not it...

be able to see this peaceful country
again with my own eyes.

you here.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>, you have been called here
today for a singular purpose.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
The <Queen> and I have been speaking
on this matter for quite some time.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me be blunt. Will you
become my heir?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
What...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
My husband and I were not blessed
with any children. Therefore...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
A-Are you sure this is a good idea?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Without a doubt. I had originally
offered this to <Finlay>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you are truly <Finlay>'s
little brother, it is the
only obvious choice.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S12>(...yet again, my brother...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you say?
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, <Ashley>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
<S12>(...I...am not a substitute...)
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, let's hear your answer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I'm afraid
I must decline your offer.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
Why is that, <Ashley>?

[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you'll excuse me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Queen>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Ashley>...
[ENDBLOCK]
<King>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought the world would
turn out like this. If only his
brother were here...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
He always maintained his composure,
but I know that within his soul there
was a burning passion.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>, who are
you talking about?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lilith>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>, he's a friend of
my brother's, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ah, yeah...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo> was an insatiable
man, but...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had high hopes for <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
But now, he's dead!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I always thought that you
loathed <Lion>, Mr. <Dryden>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
That is not true.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
I had thought I would be able to retire
once he had matured a little more.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
We had planned to have
<Lion> serve as the new
Seventh General.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> as a general!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
But that dream has
all but faded...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Dryden>
[ENDBLOCK]
He always maintained his composure,
but I know that within his soul there
was a burning passion. <x00>
