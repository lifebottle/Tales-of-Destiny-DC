We've been waiting for you.
Master Swordian, this is yours.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
We were told to
let everyone in.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion> I'm going to miss you
when you're not around.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>There is a rumor that
she tried to murder your father.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
Of course, I don't believe in that.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
This wasn't <Lion>'s fault,
but <Hugo>'s.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I can't believe it,
even <Hugo> was manipulated.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
If this fails,
we're doomed.
[ENDBLOCK]
Lady
[ENDBLOCK]
I'll ask everyone for help.
The world rests on your shoulders.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
It seems you've got the
king's trust. Who are you?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm Hugo Gilchrist, CEO
of Oberon Company.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm relying on you,
young miss.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Th-the CEO of 
Oberon Company?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
Huh? Him and <Lion> have
different last names?
Weren't both them family...?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohh, sorry to keep
you waiting!
[ENDBLOCK]
???
[ENDBLOCK]
Ohh, sorry to keep
you waiting!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You're lively as always <Reynolds>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
I brought the prisoner
monitoring device you asked,
there are two types though.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
The first one is pretty cute.
The second one is more robust.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're not alike at all!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Now, which one
do you want?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Mary>
[ENDBLOCK]
The cute one!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Okay! The
Tiara type.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
They're ready. 
Now try pressing
this switch.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
DFKJDFJGK!!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Using this, you'll be able to
shock them whenever you want!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
This is no joke! You can't make 
us wear that, this is dangerous!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
Uwaagaagagagaga!!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
If you try to force it out, this 
happens! And the transmitter
will tell us where they are
in seconds!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
How do you like it? huh?
Pretty convenient, right?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Hmm. Definitely
looks useful.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Reynolds>
[ENDBLOCK]
Welp. I'll go back to my experiments
then. Let me know how it works!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Rutee>
[ENDBLOCK]
What the hell does he mean by that...
You've gotta be kidding me...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Stahn>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm all tingly...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well then. As for your Swordians,
they were sent to my manor.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Come by and retrieve them.
I'll join you later.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
It's The biggest manor in town.
That's where we're going.
[ENDBLOCK]

<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
So you're back. Took
longer than I expected.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
My apologies <Hugo>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
So according to your report.
We've recovered two Swordians.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
His Majesty heard about this.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Take the prisoners to him.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bring mere bandits
to His Majesty's..?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Those people are suspected
of further crimes.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I've only heard of blackmail
and other such acts...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I'm sure you've heard
of the Draconis incident
the other day.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
when we lost track
of it after the 
monster attack..?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You mean to say
they are involved?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
That's right. Your Majesty
and Lord <Dryden> will
interrogate them directly.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
That was the work of monsters,
they couldn't have been involved!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What's the matter, <Lion>?
You're siding with them?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
No, that's not
what I meant...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
The Swordian that man had. Was the
one being escorted on the Draconis.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
The guy...? the blond one?
Then the girl is irrelevant...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
What do you mean? They
were working together.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Isn't it natural to suppose
they are partners?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Either way, His Excellency
won't be pleased about it.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Depending on how this goes,
execution may be considered.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Execution...!?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>, you...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You do know their names,
right <Hugo>?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
... Ah, I'm well aware.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Then you know the girl
wielding the swordian is...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
That Swordian originally
belonged to me.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
I never thought I'd get
it back. Thank you <Lion>.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
You really are...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You! Come here.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Yes, sir.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Bring the criminals
from the dungeons.
[ENDBLOCK]
Soldier
[ENDBLOCK]
Understood.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
You'll be taking them
to His Majesty.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Hugo>
[ENDBLOCK]
Have I made myself
clear, <Lion>?
[ENDBLOCK]

Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Hold on a second, Jobs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
What are you scheming, Will?
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
I want to be fair with you. No grudges.
No matter which of us gets promoted.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Seriously, dude?
Well, fine.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Let's both do our best
not to burden this guy.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Let me make
one thing clear.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
I consider this mission to
be assigned to you two.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
How will you carry out your duty?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Show me what you can do. I'll decide
who gets the promotion that way.
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
In the end, it's my job to clean up
whatever mess you make,
so do whatever you feel is best.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
All right! In that
case, I'll do it my way!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Not so fast. This is about the two
of you working together
to get the job done.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
The two of us...??
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
That's impossible! Will and I can't
even agree on who pays for lunch!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Fine. I have no use
for either of you, then.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Woah, hold up, I get it. We're
supposed to learn to work together.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
We'll make decisions together.
So, do you have a plan in mind?
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Don't overthink it.
We have a job to do.
[ENDBLOCK]
Will
[ENDBLOCK]
Right, excuse me.
OK, let's go, Jobs.
[ENDBLOCK]
Jobs
[ENDBLOCK]
Hey! You just said we'd
make decisions like this together!
[ENDBLOCK]
<Chaltier>
[ENDBLOCK]
Are those two going to be okay?
Neither seem like the leader type...
[ENDBLOCK]
<Lion>
[ENDBLOCK]
Well, it's up to me to find out.
Let's head for Harmentz, too.

<TAG_007>[Titles Description]
Titles are one of the character parameters
that can be set on a character. The
specific set method is as follows.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>After opening the main menu,
the character status will display.
On this screen, hit <Square_ani> and you'll
be able to change the character status.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>At the top of this screen, you'll see
[Titles] On this screen, press <Triangle_ani> 
and it'll let you pick from all the titles
you've acquired.

[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>There are two purposes to titles. 
The first is to [Set your title and 
talk to the townspeople].
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>By setting a title, certain townspeople
will take interest in you. When you talk
to them several times, you might get
interesting responses. When that
happens, reset the title you have on
and try talking to them again.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>Hint: When talking to townspeople, a
[?] will appear over your character's
head. If this happens, set a title that
seems to be related to the dialogue, 
and try talking to them again. 
Something fun may happen.
[ENDBLOCK]
notice
[ENDBLOCK]
<TAG_007>The second purpose of titles is...
to make your status screen look cool!
When collecting titles, you might pick
up one you like, so you can set it on
your status for a little flair!
